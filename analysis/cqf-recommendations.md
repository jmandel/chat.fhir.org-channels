# FHIR Clinical Guidelines Implementation Guide: Analysis

## 1. Objectives

This implementation guide aims to make clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) understandable by computers. This means converting guidelines, which are usually written in plain language, into a structured format that computers can process and use. The goal is to make it easier for healthcare systems to implement CPG recommendations consistently and efficiently.

## 2. Current Practices and Limitations

Currently, healthcare organizations often manually interpret and implement CPGs, leading to:

* **Duplication of effort:** Each organization has to translate the guidelines into their own systems, which is time-consuming and inefficient.
* **Variability in implementation:** Different organizations may interpret the guidelines differently, leading to inconsistencies in care.
* **Slow adoption of best practices:** It takes time to manually translate and implement guidelines, delaying the delivery of optimal care.

## 3. New Approaches

This IG introduces a standardized way to represent CPGs using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. This involves:

* **Defining profiles:**  Creating structured templates for common CPG elements like recommendations, activities, and case features.
* **Using terminology:**  Mapping clinical concepts to standard terminologies to ensure consistent meaning.
* **Expressing logic:** Using Clinical Quality Language (CQL) to formally represent the decision-making logic in guidelines.
* **Packaging artifacts:** Bundling all the necessary components (profiles, terminology, logic) for easy distribution and implementation.

## 4. Contextual Factors and Design Decisions

* **Focus on interoperability:** This IG leverages existing standards like FHIR and CQL to promote interoperability and reusability of CPG content.
* **Integrated development approach:** The IG advocates for involving all stakeholders (guideline developers, informaticists, implementers) in the process to ensure the computable guidelines are accurate, feasible, and valuable.
* **Agile methodology:** The IG recommends an iterative and incremental approach to development, allowing for flexibility and adaptation as new evidence emerges.
* **Emphasis on patient safety:** The IG stresses the importance of considering clinical safety throughout the development and implementation process.
* **Flexibility in rating systems:** The IG acknowledges the variability in grading systems used by different guidelines and provides a framework for representing these ratings.
* **Support for various levels of enablement:** The IG recognizes that different healthcare systems have varying technical capabilities and supports different levels of implementation complexity.
