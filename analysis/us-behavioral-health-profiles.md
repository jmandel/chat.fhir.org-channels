# US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Plus Behavioral Health (BH) dataset: Analysis

## 1. Objectives

This Implementation Guide (IG) aims to improve how behavioral health information is shared between different healthcare systems in the United States. It wants to make it easier for hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare providers to exchange information about patients with mental health and substance use disorders. This should help providers make better decisions about patient care and ultimately improve outcomes for these patients.

## 2. Previous Approaches and Limitations

Previously, behavioral health information was often fragmented and difficult to share. This was due to several factors:

* **Lack of standardization:** There was no common set of data elements for capturing behavioral health information.
* **Limited health IT adoption:** Behavioral health providers often lagged behind other healthcare providers in adopting electronic health records and other health IT systems.
* **Ineligibility for incentive programs:** Some behavioral health providers were not eligible for financial incentives that encouraged the use of health IT.
* **Complexity of documentation:** Documenting behavioral health encounters is complex, which further hindered the sharing of this information.

## 3. Introduced Approaches

This IG introduces the following approaches:

* **Standardized data elements:** It establishes a core set of standardized data elements for capturing behavioral health information, known as the USCDI+ BH dataset.
* **FHIR profiles:** It uses FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), a modern healthcare data exchange standard, to define how these data elements should be represented and exchanged electronically.
* **Alignment with existing standards:** The IG aligns with existing standards and regulations, where possible, to ensure consistency and interoperability.

**Technical Approach:**

The IG leverages FHIR profiles, which are essentially templates that define how specific data elements should be structured and exchanged using FHIR resources. These profiles are based on the US Core Implementation Guide, which provides a foundation for representing common healthcare data elements in FHIR. Where necessary, the IG introduces custom profiles to address the unique needs of behavioral health data.

## 4. Scope Decisions, Design Choices, and Contextual Factors

* **Focus on adult patients:** The IG specifically focuses on data elements relevant to the treatment of adults with mental health and substance use disorders.
* **Use of DocumentReference:** The IG utilizes the DocumentReference FHIR resource to manage different types of clinical documents, including PDFs, scanned records, clinical notes, images, and videos.
* **Challenges in standardizing assessments:** The IG acknowledges the difficulties in standardizing health assessments, noting that the selected assessments are not exhaustive and may not be the most commonly used in practice.
* **Proprietary assessments:** The IG highlights the challenge posed by proprietary and licensed health status assessments, which may be difficult to include in future development.
* **Collaboration with stakeholders:** The development of the IG involved extensive collaboration with various stakeholders, including clinicians, patient advocates, IT developers, and policymakers.
* **Alignment with SAMHSA reporting requirements:** The IG is aligned with the reporting requirements of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), supporting funding, reporting, and performance measurement.
