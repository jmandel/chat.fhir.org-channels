# mCODE: Analysis

## 1. Objectives

The mCODE (Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) Implementation Guide aims to standardize how electronic health records (EHRs) store and share information about cancer patients. This will make it easier for healthcare providers, researchers, and public health agencies to access and use this data, ultimately leading to better cancer care and research.

## 2. Previous Approaches and Limitations

Previously, there was no widely adopted standard for representing oncology data in EHRs. This made it difficult to exchange information between different health systems and to conduct large-scale research studies. Data was often locked within individual EHR systems, limiting its usefulness. Existing standards like HL7 CDA R2 and DICOM did not fully address the specific needs of oncology.

## 3. Introduced Approaches and Technical Approach

mCODE introduces a set of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) profiles that define how to represent key oncology data elements in a structured and standardized way. These profiles cover various aspects of cancer care, including patient demographics, diagnosis, staging, treatment, and outcomes. mCODE leverages existing terminologies like SNOMED CT, LOINC, and RxNorm to ensure consistency and interoperability.

The technical approach involves defining FHIR profiles that constrain and extend base FHIR resources to meet the specific requirements of oncology. These profiles specify the data elements, data types, value sets, and cardinality constraints for representing oncology information. mCODE also defines extensions to capture additional data elements not present in base FHIR resources.

## 4. Scope Decisions, Design Choices, and Contextual Factors

* **Focus on Minimal Data Elements:** mCODE focuses on a core set of data elements considered essential for oncology care and research, rather than trying to capture every possible data point.
* **Alignment with US Core:** mCODE builds upon the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) standard, ensuring compatibility with broader healthcare interoperability efforts in the United States.
* **Support for Non-TNM Staging:** Recognizing that not all cancers are staged using the TNM system, mCODE includes profiles for representing non-TNM staging systems commonly used in hematologic malignancies and other cancer types.
* **Integration with Genomics Reporting:** mCODE incorporates profiles from the HL7 Clinical Genomics Work Group's Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide, enabling the representation of genomic data relevant to cancer care.
* **Emphasis on Structured Data:** mCODE promotes the use of structured data elements with controlled terminologies, facilitating data analysis and interoperability.
* **Collaboration with Stakeholders:** mCODE was developed through a collaborative process involving clinical experts, informaticists, and vendors, ensuring its relevance and practicality.
* **Use of Capability Statements:** mCODE utilizes FHIR Capability Statements to define the capabilities of data senders and receivers, facilitating interoperability and conformance testing.

These design choices and contextual factors reflect mCODE's goal of creating a practical and implementable standard that can improve cancer care and research by enabling seamless data exchange and analysis.
