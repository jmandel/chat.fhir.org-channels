# CQF Measures: Analysis

## 1. Objectives

This implementation guide aims to standardize how digital quality measures (dQMs) are created and shared. dQMs are essentially electronic rules used to assess the quality of healthcare services. By making these rules consistent and machine-readable, healthcare providers, technology vendors, and quality reporting agencies can work together more efficiently. This means better data collection, accurate reporting, and ultimately, improved healthcare quality.

## 2. Current Practices and Limitations

Before this guide, quality measures were often defined in different formats, leading to inconsistencies and difficulties in electronic processing. For example, the Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF) was a standard, but it relied on human interpretation and lacked the precision for direct use in electronic systems. This made it hard to compare data across different organizations and automate quality reporting.

## 3. New Approaches

This guide leverages two key technologies:

* **FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources):** FHIR is a modern standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. This guide defines how to use FHIR resources to represent dQMs in a structured and consistent manner.
* **CQL (Clinical Quality Language):** CQL is a language specifically designed to express the logic of clinical quality measures. This guide outlines how to use CQL to define the rules and criteria within a dQM, making them computable by machines.

By combining FHIR and CQL, this guide enables the creation of dQMs that are:

* **Machine-readable:**  Allowing for automated processing and analysis.
* **Shareable:** Facilitating consistent implementation across different systems.
* **Precise:** Reducing ambiguity and ensuring accurate evaluation of healthcare quality.

## 4. Contextual Factors and Design Decisions

* **Focus on Computability:** The primary focus is on making dQMs computable, enabling automated evaluation and reporting.
* **Alignment with Existing Standards:** The guide leverages and extends existing standards like FHIR and CQL to ensure compatibility and broader adoption.
* **Layered Approach:** The guide defines different levels of profiles to accommodate varying levels of implementation capabilities.
* **Terminology Management:**  The guide provides guidance on managing and referencing medical terminologies, crucial for accurate and consistent interpretation of dQMs.
* **Data Requirements:**  The guide highlights the importance of clearly defining the data needed to evaluate a dQM, facilitating efficient data collection and exchange.

Understanding these factors is essential for successful implementation and utilization of the standardized dQMs defined in this guide.
