# uv-dx-pq: Analysis

## 1. Objectives

This implementation guide aims to create a standardized, structured format for exchanging pharmaceutical quality data between different entities in the biopharmaceutical industry. This includes information about how drugs are developed, manufactured, what materials are used, and the quality control measures in place. 

The goal is to move away from sharing this data in unstructured documents like Word files and PDFs, and instead use a format that is machine-readable and can be easily integrated with different software systems. This will make it easier to manage, share, and analyze this data, ultimately leading to faster drug development and more efficient manufacturing processes.

## 2. Previous Approaches and Limitations

Traditionally, pharmaceutical quality data has been authored, managed, and transmitted in unstructured Word files or PDFs, often following the structure defined by the ICH Common Technical Document (CTD). This approach has become unsustainable due to:

* **Increasing volume, complexity, and frequency of quality work:** The current system struggles to keep up with the growing amount of data generated.
* **Limited data reuse and sharing:**  Data locked in unstructured formats is difficult to reuse across different products and processes.
* **Inefficient and time-consuming data exchange:** Exchanging information through documents leads to slow and manual processes.

## 3.  Technical Approach

This IG leverages the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard, specifically version 5.0.0, to structure and exchange pharmaceutical quality data. The key aspects of this approach are:

* **High granularity:** The IG breaks down quality data into 14 distinct domains, each representing a major quality concept (e.g., Stability, Container Closure System). Within each domain, data is further structured into individual data elements with a high level of detail. This allows for flexible data management, reuse, and transformation into various output formats.
* **Use of FHIR resources:** The IG defines specific FHIR resources (e.g., SubstanceDefinition, MedicinalProductDefinition, ObservationDefinition) to represent different aspects of quality data. These resources are combined into bundles to represent larger concepts like stability studies or test specifications.
* **API-based data exchange:** The IG envisions a future where data is exchanged between systems in real-time using FHIR-compliant APIs. This will significantly accelerate data sharing and streamline workflows. 

## 4. Scope and Design Choices

* **Focus on industry data exchange:**  The IG specifically focuses on data exchange within a biopharmaceutical company, between companies, or between companies and their stakeholders (e.g., contract labs, contract manufacturers). It is not intended for submissions to regulatory authorities, though it allows for data transformation into formats compliant with regulatory requirements.
* **Prioritization of international standards:** The IG aligns with the ISO IDMP standard, referencing EDQM terminology for dose forms, routes of administration, etc. This ensures consistency and interoperability with other systems using IDMP. 
* **Emphasis on examples:** The IG prioritizes the use of example files over strict profile definitions, recognizing the importance of practical implementation guidance for early adopters.
