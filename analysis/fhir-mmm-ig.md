# Longitudinal Maternal & Child Health Information for Research FHIR R4: Analysis

## 1. Objectives 
This Implementation Guide (IG) aims to make it easier for researchers studying maternal and child health to access and analyze clinical information. It defines a standardized way to gather and exchange data about pregnant women and their children, helping researchers investigate factors related to maternal mortality and child health outcomes. By creating a common framework for data sharing, the IG hopes to improve research efficiency and ultimately contribute to better health outcomes for mothers and children.

## 2. Previous Approaches and Limitations
Previously, data related to maternal health was not standardized and difficult to exchange between different healthcare settings. This lack of interoperability made it challenging to conduct comprehensive research on maternal morbidity and its impact on child health. Additionally, maternal and child health data were often stored in separate systems, hindering efforts to study their interconnectedness. These limitations led to the development of this IG to address the need for a unified and interoperable approach to maternal and child health data exchange for research purposes.

## 3. Technical Approach
This IG introduces a standardized framework for representing and exchanging maternal and child health data using the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. It leverages existing FHIR profiles, such as the US Core profiles and Vital Records Common Profiles, to ensure consistency and interoperability with other health information systems. The IG also utilizes Clinical Quality Language (CQL) expressions to define specific research populations (e.g., women who died within a year of pregnancy, women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy).  

The IG defines a process for data exchange where researchers can query data sources (e.g., EHR systems, registries) for information related to the defined research populations. The data is then transformed into standardized FHIR resources and evaluated using the FHIR Clinical Reasoning Module, specifically the "$evaluate-measure" operation. This process enables researchers to identify relevant patient cohorts and aggregate their clinical information for analysis.

## 4. Scope, Design Choices, and Contextual Factors
**Important Scope Decisions:**

*   **Focus on Longitudinal Maternal Care:** The IG primarily focuses on information relevant to maternal care during the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum periods, including pre-pregnancy health.
*   **Linkage of Maternal and Child Records:** The IG emphasizes the importance of linking maternal records with associated child records to facilitate research on the interconnectedness of maternal and child health.
*   **Initial Use Cases:** The IG initially focuses on two specific research use cases: pregnancy and subsequent death within a timeframe and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

**Design Choices:**

*   **Use of FHIR:** The IG leverages the FHIR standard as the foundation for data representation and exchange, promoting interoperability with existing health information systems.
*   **US Core Profiles:** The IG utilizes US Core profiles wherever possible to ensure consistency and alignment with broader health information exchange efforts.
*   **Clinical Quality Language (CQL):** The IG employs CQL to define research populations and facilitate the identification of relevant patient cohorts.

**Contextual Factors:**

*   **Rising Maternal Mortality Rates:** The IG is developed in response to the rising maternal mortality rates in the United States and the need for research to understand and address this trend.
*   **Need for Standardized Data:** The IG recognizes the lack of standardization in maternal health data and aims to provide a framework for consistent data capture and exchange.
*   **Importance of Data Sharing:** The IG emphasizes the importance of data sharing among different healthcare settings and research institutions to facilitate comprehensive research on maternal and child health.
