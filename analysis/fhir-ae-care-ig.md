# FHIR Adverse Event Clinical Care IG: Analysis

## 1. Objectives 

This implementation guide (IG) aims to standardize how healthcare professionals record and share information about adverse events, particularly those occurring during clinical care. It focuses on creating a consistent way to document details like who experienced the event, what caused it, and what actions were taken in response. The goal is to improve communication and understanding of adverse events across different healthcare settings, ultimately enhancing patient safety and quality of care.


## 2. Previous Approaches and Limitations

The provided source files do not explicitly describe how adverse event reporting was handled previously or the limitations of those approaches. Therefore, I cannot answer this question based on the information provided.


## 3.  Approaches and Technical Approach

This IG introduces a standardized way to represent adverse event information using the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. It defines a specific "profile" called "AdverseEvent Clinical Care" which guides how to structure the data elements related to an adverse event. 

**Technical Approach:**

- **FHIR Profiles:** It leverages FHIR profiles to constrain and tailor the existing "AdverseEvent" resource within FHIR to better suit the needs of clinical care settings.
- **Data Elements:** It specifies which data elements are essential for capturing information about adverse events in clinical care, such as the patient, the event itself, the suspected cause, and actions taken.
- **Examples:** The IG provides concrete examples of how to represent adverse event data using FHIR, making it easier for implementers to understand and adopt the standard.


## 4. Important Contextual Factors and Design Decisions

- **Clinical Focus:** The IG is specifically designed for adverse event reporting in clinical care scenarios, such as incident reporting systems within hospitals or clinics.
- **Two-Stage Workflow:** The use case examples highlight the importance of a potential two-stage workflow, where initial reporting might be done by a nurse followed by a physician review and diagnosis.
- **Flexibility:** The IG acknowledges that not all information about an adverse event may be available at the initial reporting stage and allows for updates as more information becomes available.
- **Data Sharing:** By using FHIR, the IG promotes interoperability, enabling the exchange of adverse event information between different systems and organizations.
