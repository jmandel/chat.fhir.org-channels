# CDS Hooks Library: Analysis

## 1. Objectives

This Implementation Guide (IG), titled "CDS Hooks Library," aims to standardize how clinical decision support (CDS) tools interact with electronic health records (EHRs) during specific clinical workflow steps. It defines a set of standard "hooks" â€“ points in the EHR workflow where external CDS services can be triggered to provide advice or recommendations. By standardizing these hooks, the IG enables CDS tools to be more easily integrated with different EHR systems, promoting interoperability and broader use of CDS to improve healthcare decisions.

## 2. Current Practices and Limitations

Currently, integrating CDS tools with EHRs often involves custom development for each EHR system, which is costly and time-consuming. This lack of standardization limits the availability and adoption of CDS tools, hindering their potential to improve healthcare quality and efficiency.

## 3. New Approaches and Technical Approach

The IG introduces a standardized approach for invoking CDS services at specific points in the clinical workflow, called "hooks." Each hook is defined with a specific name (e.g., "order-sign," "patient-view"), a description of the workflow context, and the data elements available to the CDS service. The CDS service can then use this information to provide relevant and timely advice or recommendations to the clinician.

Technically, CDS Hooks relies on a lightweight, web-based API using the FHIR standard for data exchange. When a defined hook is triggered in the EHR, it sends a request to the CDS service, including the relevant context information in FHIR format. The CDS service processes the request and returns a response, also in FHIR format, which may include "cards" containing advice, suggestions, or links to external resources. The EHR then displays these cards to the clinician within its user interface.


## 4. Important Contextual Factors and Design Decisions

* **Hook Maturity Model:** The IG defines a maturity model for hooks, ranging from "Draft" to "Mature," indicating the level of testing and adoption of each hook.
* **FHIR Version Agnosticism:** CDS Hooks is designed to be agnostic of the specific FHIR version used by the EHR, allowing for flexibility and broader compatibility.
* **Focus on Specific Workflow Steps:** The IG focuses on standardizing hooks for specific, well-defined workflow steps, such as order signing or patient view, where CDS can have the most impact.
* **Open Community Process:** The IG is developed through an open community process, allowing for input and feedback from various stakeholders, including EHR vendors, CDS developers, and clinicians.
* **Deprecation of Hooks:** The IG includes a process for deprecating hooks that are no longer relevant or have been replaced by more mature alternatives, ensuring the ongoing evolution and improvement of the standard.

Understanding these factors and design decisions is crucial for successful implementation and adoption of CDS Hooks, ultimately fostering a more interoperable and CDS-driven healthcare ecosystem.
