# fhir-breast-radiology-ig: Analysis

## 1. Objectives

This implementation guide aims to standardize the representation of breast imaging reports using the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. It seeks to facilitate the exchange of breast imaging information, including findings, assessments, and recommendations, between different healthcare systems and providers in a structured and machine-readable format. 

## 2. Previous Approaches and Limitations

The provided source files do not explicitly describe previous approaches or limitations that led to the development of this IG. 

## 3. Technical Approach

This IG introduces a set of FHIR profiles and extensions specifically designed for breast imaging reports. Key aspects of the technical approach include:

* **Profiles:** The IG defines profiles for various observation types relevant to breast imaging, such as `MGFinding`, `MRIFinding`, `USFinding`, `CystAbnormality`, `MassAbnormality`, etc. These profiles constrain and extend the base FHIR `Observation` resource to capture specific data elements and terminologies relevant to breast imaging.
* **Extensions:** The IG introduces extensions like `BreastLateralityExtension` and `BreastBodyLocationExtension` to represent breast laterality and precise anatomical locations within the breast.
* **Value Sets and Code Systems:** The IG utilizes existing terminologies like RadLex, SNOMED CT, and LOINC, and also defines custom code systems and value sets to represent concepts specific to breast imaging, such as `ObservedChangesCS`, `ConsistentWithVS`, `ServiceRecommendationsVS`, etc.
* **Composition Resource:** The IG utilizes the `Composition` resource to structure the breast imaging report, defining specific sections for report content, impressions, findings for left and right breasts, related resources, and recommendations.

## 4. Contextual Factors and Design Decisions

* **Reliance on Existing Standards:** The IG leverages existing standards like RadLex, SNOMED CT, and LOINC to ensure interoperability and semantic consistency.
* **Focus on Granularity:** The IG defines profiles and component slices to capture detailed information about breast abnormalities, including their type, location, size, shape, density, and other associated features.
* **Support for Multiple Modalities:** The IG accommodates findings from various breast imaging modalities, such as mammography, MRI, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine.
* **Emphasis on Recommendations:** The IG includes profiles for service recommendations and medication requests, enabling the structured representation of follow-up actions based on the imaging findings.
* **U.S. Focus:** The IG explicitly states a U.S. jurisdiction, suggesting its primary target audience and potential regulatory considerations.
