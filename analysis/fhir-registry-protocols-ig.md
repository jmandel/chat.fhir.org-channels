# FHIR Registry Protocols IG: Analysis

## 1. Objectives

This implementation guide aims to simplify and standardize how healthcare providers submit data to clinical registries. It wants to automate the process of collecting the necessary information from various healthcare systems, like electronic health records (EHRs), and formatting it correctly for submission to the registry.

## 2. Previous Problems and Limitations

Previously, registries defined their own data submission formats and vocabulary requirements. Healthcare providers had to manually map data from their systems to the registry's format, a time-consuming and error-prone process. Additionally, not all data was readily available within their systems, requiring manual searches and data entry from various sources. This lack of standardization and automation created inefficiencies and potential data quality issues.

## 3. Introduced Approaches and Technical Approach

This IG introduces a framework based on the HL7 FHIR standard. It uses FHIR resources to:

- **Communicate data dictionaries:** Registries can use FHIR's "StructureDefinition" resource to define their data requirements in a standardized way.
- **Map data locations:** The StructureDefinition can specify where the required data can be found in various healthcare systems, using FHIR, CDA documents, or HL7 V2 messages.
- **Automate data extraction:** Healthcare systems can query different data sources using FHIR APIs and FHIRPath, a query language, to extract the necessary information automatically.
- **Standardize submission format:** The extracted data is then transformed into a FHIR Bundle, a standardized collection of FHIR resources, for submission to the registry.

## 4. Important Scope Decisions and Design Choices

- **Focus on automation:** The IG emphasizes automation to improve efficiency and data quality.
- **Reliance on existing standards:** It leverages existing FHIR resources and profiles, promoting interoperability.
- **Support for multiple data sources:** It accommodates data from EHRs, CDA documents, HL7 V2 messages, and manual entry.
- **Flexibility in submission methods:** It supports various submission methods, including single bundles, bulk submissions, and asynchronous uploads.
- **Emphasis on security and data privacy:** It highlights security considerations and recommends appropriate data sensitivity classifications.
- **Clear conformance expectations:** It defines specific requirements for systems to conform to the IG.

## Contextual Factors

- **Growing importance of registries:** Clinical registries play a crucial role in healthcare quality improvement and research.
- **Need for interoperability:**  Standardized data exchange is essential for efficient and effective data sharing.
- **Adoption of FHIR:**  FHIR is gaining traction as a modern standard for healthcare interoperability.

This IG aims to address a significant challenge in healthcare data exchange by providing a standardized and automated framework for registry submissions. Its success depends on the adoption of FHIR and the willingness of registries and healthcare providers to implement its recommendations.
