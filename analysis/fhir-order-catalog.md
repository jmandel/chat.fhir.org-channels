# FHIR Order Catalog IG: Analysis

## 1. Objectives

This implementation guide aims to standardize how catalogs of medical products (medications and devices) are represented and exchanged using the FHIR standard. It seeks to make it easier for different computer systems to share and understand information about these products, facilitating tasks like browsing catalogs, searching for specific products, and retrieving detailed information about them. 

## 2. Previous Approaches and Limitations

The provided source files don't explicitly describe previous approaches or their limitations. However, it does mention mapping between the IG's data elements and jurisdictional device databases like GUDID and EUDAMED. This suggests that previously, device information may have been managed in disparate, jurisdiction-specific databases, leading to interoperability challenges. 

## 3. Technical Approach

The IG introduces a structured approach using FHIR resources and profiles to represent medical product catalogs.

* **Catalog Representation:** Catalogs are represented using the `Composition` resource with a `CatalogHeader` profile for general properties. Items within the catalog (e.g., specific devices or medications) can be referenced by the catalog or reference the catalog header.
* **Device Models:** `DeviceDefinition` with a `DeviceModel` profile is used to describe specific device models, including identifiers, classifications, safety characteristics, and properties.
* **Medication Knowledge:** `MedicationKnowledge` with a `DrugKnowledge` profile represents information about medications, including indications, dosage forms, ingredients, and packaging details.
* **Searching and Retrieval:** The IG defines search parameters for `DeviceDefinition` and `MedicationKnowledge` to enable efficient searching within catalogs. It supports two search approaches: a two-step approach for browsing and then retrieving details, and a one-step approach for retrieving full details immediately.
* **Mappings to Existing Databases:** The IG includes mappings between its data elements and fields in GUDID and EUDAMED, aiding in data exchange and harmonization with existing device databases.

## 4. Scope Decisions, Design Choices, and Contextual Factors

* **Focus on Medications and Devices:** The IG explicitly focuses on catalogs of medications and medical devices. 
* **Two Catalog Representation Methods:** The IG offers flexibility in how catalog items are linked to the catalog itself (either the catalog referencing items or items referencing the catalog header).
* **Support for Iteration in Search:** The IG allows clients to retrieve related resources along with the main search results (e.g., retrieving clinical use definitions along with a device model) using the `_include:iterate=*` parameter.
* **Jurisdictional Considerations:** The IG acknowledges the importance of jurisdictional regulations and includes mappings to GUDID (US) and EUDAMED (EU).
* **Use of Existing FHIR Resources:** The IG leverages existing FHIR resources like `Composition`, `DeviceDefinition`, and `MedicationKnowledge` and extends them with profiles to meet the specific needs of medical product catalogs.
