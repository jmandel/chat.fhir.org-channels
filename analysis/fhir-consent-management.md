# FHIR Consent Management: Analysis

## 1. Objectives

This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize how patient consent for accessing their health data is managed and communicated digitally. It focuses on defining how different systems can interact to determine if a specific entity (like a doctor or insurance company) has the right to view a patient's health information based on the patient's consent. 

In simpler terms, it's like creating a digital rulebook for how healthcare providers ask for, track, and respect patient choices about who can see their medical records.

## 2. Previous Approaches and Limitations

While FHIR Core and other existing specifications had basic support for managing consents (like creating and updating consent records), they lacked detailed instructions on how to handle the entire consent process. This IG was developed to address these limitations:

* **Lack of guidance on patient interaction:**  There wasn't a standard way to handle how patients are informed about consent requests, how they make choices, and how they can review or change their decisions (the "consent ceremony").
* **Missing API specifications:** A standardized API was needed to allow different systems to exchange consent information efficiently, particularly for complex scenarios like sharing consent across multiple organizations.

## 3.  Approaches Introduced

This IG introduces several approaches to improve consent management:

* **Standardized Use Cases:** It defines common scenarios like requesting, reviewing, signing, delegating, and revoking consent, providing a framework for consistent implementation.
* **Custom FHIR Operations and Profiles:**  It introduces new FHIR resources (like "FASTConsent") tailored to consent management and defines specific operations (actions) that can be performed on these resources. This enables systems to exchange consent-related information in a structured and interoperable way.
* **Focus on Consent Decision:**  The IG emphasizes determining whether access is granted based on consent, leaving broader authorization (legal and policy-based access control) outside its scope.

**Technical Approach:**

The IG leverages FHIR resources (like Consent, Task, Provenance, AuditEvent) and extends them with custom profiles and operations to capture consent-specific details. This allows for the representation of consent information in a standard format that can be exchanged between different systems using FHIR APIs.

## 4. Important Contextual Factors and Design Decisions

* **Scope Limitation:** The IG explicitly focuses on consent for data access, excluding other types of consent like consent for treatment.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** The IG does not address user authentication (verifying identity) or the broader authorization process. It assumes these functions are handled by other systems.
* **Scalability:** The IG aims to support scenarios where consent information needs to be shared across multiple organizations, potentially on a large scale.
* **Emphasis on User Experience:** The IG highlights the importance of a clear and user-friendly process for patients to understand and manage their consent choices.
* **Provenance and Auditability:** The IG emphasizes the need to track the history of consent decisions and any related events (like sharing or revocation) for accountability and transparency.
