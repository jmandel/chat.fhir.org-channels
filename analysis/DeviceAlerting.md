# DeviceAlerting: Analysis

## 1. Objectives 

Based on the provided information, it's difficult to definitively state the IG's objectives without more context. The name "DeviceAlerting" suggests it might be related to managing and responding to alerts generated by medical devices. However, the provided code snippets (a placeholder index page and a basic patient profile definition) don't offer specific details about its functionality. 

It seems the IG is in very early stages of development and might aim to standardize how patient information and device alerts are handled within a healthcare setting.

## 2. Previous Approaches and Limitations

The provided input files do not contain information about previous approaches or limitations that led to the development of this IG.

## 3.  Approaches and Technical Approach

The IG uses FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) as its technical approach. FHIR is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. 

The provided code snippet shows the use of FSH (FHIR Shorthand), a language for defining FHIR profiles and other FHIR artifacts in a concise and human-readable way. It defines a "MyPatient" profile that extends the base FHIR "Patient" resource, adding a requirement for at least one "name" element.

Based on the limited information, it can be inferred that the IG might leverage FHIR resources to represent device alerts and potentially integrate them with patient data.

## 4. Contextual Factors and Design Decisions

Based on the name "DeviceAlerting," a crucial contextual factor is the increasing use of medical devices in healthcare and the need for effective management of alerts generated by these devices.  

A key design decision appears to be the adoption of FHIR as the underlying standard, which promotes interoperability and allows the IG to leverage existing FHIR infrastructure and tooling. 

However, without further information from the IG, it is difficult to identify other contextual factors or design decisions.
