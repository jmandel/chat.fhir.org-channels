# FHIR AE Research IG: Analysis

## 1. Objectives

This implementation guide aims to standardize how adverse events (AEs) are captured and exchanged in clinical research. It does this by creating a common language and format for representing AE data, regardless of whether it comes from electronic health records, patient-reported outcomes, or other sources. This makes it easier to share AE information between different systems used in clinical research, such as those used by hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory agencies like the FDA.

## 2. Previous Approaches and Limitations

Previously, AE data was often collected and stored in different ways across various systems, leading to inconsistencies and difficulties in sharing information. This required manual transcription of AE data into clinical trial management systems, which was inefficient and prone to errors. Existing standards, while helpful, did not fully address the need for a standardized approach to capturing and exchanging AE data in clinical research.

## 3. Technical Approach

This IG leverages the HL7 FHIR standard to create a specific profile for representing AEs in clinical research. This profile, called "AdverseEvent Clinical Research Profile," defines the necessary data elements and their format, ensuring consistency and interoperability. It also outlines potential workflows for collecting and reporting AEs, both during pre-market clinical trials and post-market surveillance.

## 4. Contextual Factors and Design Decisions

- **Focus on Clinical Research:** This IG is specifically designed for AEs occurring in the context of clinical research, addressing the unique data elements and workflows relevant to this domain. 
- **Interoperability:** The use of FHIR promotes interoperability, allowing AE data to be easily exchanged between different systems. 
- **Regulatory Reporting:** The IG considers regulatory requirements, such as those from the FDA, ensuring that the data captured can be used for reporting purposes. 
- **Future Expansion:** The IG acknowledges the need for future expansion, particularly regarding the integration with MedWatch, the FDA's safety information and adverse event reporting program. 
- **Use Case Specific Guidance:** The IG emphasizes the importance of deriving use case-specific guidance from the foundational profile, recognizing that different scenarios may require additional data elements or workflows. 
- **Real-World Examples:** The IG includes examples from real-world scenarios to demonstrate how the AE profile can be used in practice.
