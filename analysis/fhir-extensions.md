# FHIR IG for Extensions and Constraints: Analysis

## 1. Objectives

This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize the way healthcare information is exchanged by:

*   **Defining custom extensions:** These extensions allow for the inclusion of additional information within FHIR resources that are not part of the core FHIR specification, enabling more comprehensive and detailed data exchange.
*   **Providing standard terminology:** It introduces code systems and value sets to ensure consistent meaning and interpretation of healthcare data across different systems.
*   **Defining validation rules:** It outlines how to create custom validation rules (constraints) for questionnaires, ensuring data quality and consistency by specifying criteria that the data must meet.

## 2. Previous Approaches and Limitations

The provided excerpts don't explicitly describe how the problems addressed by this IG were handled previously. However, based on the content, we can infer the following:

*   **Extensions:** Before this IG, custom extensions might have been developed inconsistently across different implementations, leading to interoperability challenges.
*   **Terminology:** The lack of standardized code systems and value sets could have resulted in ambiguous or inconsistent use of terminology, hindering data exchange and analysis.
*   **Validation:** Without defined validation rules, data quality and consistency might have relied on ad-hoc or implementation-specific approaches, leading to potential errors and inconsistencies.

## 3. Technical Approach

This IG introduces the following approaches:

*   **Extension Registry:** It establishes a central registry for extensions, providing a standardized way to define and share custom extensions.
*   **Terminology Resources:** It defines code systems and value sets using FHIR's terminology resources (CodeSystem and ValueSet), enabling consistent use of healthcare terms.
*   **Constraint Definition:** It leverages FHIR's constraint framework to define custom validation rules for questionnaires, including severity levels, error messages, and FHIRPath expressions for validation logic.

## 4. Scope, Design Choices, and Context

*   **Scope:** This IG focuses specifically on extensions, terminology, and validation rules related to questionnaires and potentially other FHIR resources.
*   **Design Choices:** The IG adopts a structured approach by using FHIR's built-in mechanisms for extensions, terminology, and constraints. It also provides detailed guidance on how to define and use these features.
*   **Context:** This IG is developed within the broader context of the FHIR standard, aiming to enhance its capabilities and promote interoperability in healthcare information exchange.
