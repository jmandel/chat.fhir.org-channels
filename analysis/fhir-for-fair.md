# FHIR for FAIR: Analysis

## 1. Objectives

This implementation guide (IG) aims to make it easier for healthcare researchers and data scientists to find, access, understand, and reuse healthcare data. It does this by providing guidance on how to structure and describe healthcare data using the HL7 FHIR standard, a widely recognized standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. By adhering to the principles outlined in this guide, researchers can ensure that their data is well-organized, well-documented, and easily discoverable by others, ultimately promoting collaboration and accelerating scientific discovery in healthcare.

## 2. Previous Approaches and Limitations

Previously, research data was often stored in various formats and systems, making it difficult to find and reuse. Existing metadata schemas lacked consistency and often did not include essential information like licensing or provenance, hindering findability and reusability. Researchers had to manually clarify data semantics and provenance, creating a time-consuming and inefficient process. 

## 3. Approaches Introduced

This IG introduces a structured approach to FAIRification of healthcare data using HL7 FHIR. It leverages FHIR resources, profiles, and extensions to represent both data and metadata in a standardized and machine-readable format. 

**Technical Approach:**

- **Mapping data and metadata to FHIR resources:**  The IG provides guidance on mapping existing data elements to appropriate FHIR resources like Patient, Encounter, Observation, and others.
- **Defining FHIR profiles:**  It defines profiles that specify which FHIR elements are required or recommended for specific use cases, ensuring consistency and richer metadata.
- **Using FHIR extensions:** When existing FHIR resources lack specific elements, the IG defines extensions to capture additional metadata, like licensing information or data provenance.
- **Leveraging FHIR search framework:** The IG encourages the use of FHIR's search capabilities to enable discovery of data based on rich metadata.

## 4. Scope Decisions, Design Choices, and Contextual Factors

- **Focus on native FHIR solutions:**  The IG primarily focuses on scenarios where HL7 FHIR is used natively to represent data, assuming FHIR resources are the FAIR data objects.
- **Incremental and iterative approach:** The IG acknowledges that FAIRification is an ongoing process and encourages an incremental approach, prioritizing essential metadata and gradually expanding over time.
- **Community-driven development:** The IG emphasizes the importance of community involvement in defining rich metadata, developing FHIR profiles, and specifying implementation guides tailored to specific use cases.
- **Reliance on existing standards:** The IG promotes the reuse of existing FHIR resources, profiles, and terminologies whenever possible, minimizing the need for custom development.
- **Prioritization of interoperability and reusability:** While supporting all FAIR principles, the IG particularly highlights the value of FHIR in achieving interoperability and reusability of healthcare data.
