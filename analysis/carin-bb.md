# CARIN Consumer Directed Payer Data Exchange (CARIN IG for Blue ButtonÂ®): Analysis

## 1. Objectives

This implementation guide aims to standardize how health insurance companies share patient claims and encounter information with third-party applications authorized by the patient. This enables patients to access their data in a user-friendly format through apps they trust, allowing them to manage their healthcare expenses and understand their benefits better.

## 2. Current Practices and Limitations

Currently, patients often receive claims information through physical mail or via payer portals. These methods have limitations:

* **Lack of Standardization:** Payer portals and documents vary widely in format, making it difficult for apps to collect and process the data consistently.
* **Limited Accessibility:**  Data is locked within specific portals, restricting patients from using apps that could help them analyze and manage their healthcare expenses.
* **Poor Interoperability:**  Sharing data between different payers or with providers is cumbersome and often requires manual intervention.

## 3. Technical Approach and Innovation

This IG introduces a standardized approach using the HL7 FHIR standard to:

* **Structure Data:** Defines specific profiles for ExplanationOfBenefit (EOB) resources, along with supporting resources like Patient, Coverage, and Practitioner, based on existing claim submission standards (UB-04, CMS 1500, ADA Dental Claim Form, and NCPDP).
* **Enable API Access:** Outlines how payers should build APIs that allow authorized apps to retrieve patient data using standardized queries and responses in FHIR format.
* **Ensure Interoperability:**  By using FHIR, the IG promotes seamless data exchange between payers and different applications, facilitating data aggregation and analysis.
* **Support Consumer Access:** Leverages the SMART App Launch Framework for secure authorization and authentication, ensuring that only patient-approved apps can access the data.

## 4. Contextual Factors and Design Decisions

* **Compliance with Regulations:** The IG aligns with CMS interoperability rules, ensuring that payers meet regulatory requirements for patient data access.
* **Data Licensing:**  Many codes used in the IG are proprietary and require licensing, which app developers need to consider. The IG provides guidance on handling these licensing requirements.
* **Handling Missing Data:** The IG defines how to manage missing data elements, ensuring consistent interpretation by both payers and applications.
* **US Core Alignment:**  The IG builds upon US Core profiles for common resources, promoting broader interoperability within the US healthcare system.
* **Collaboration with Da Vinci Project:** The IG complements the Da Vinci Payer Data Exchange (PDex) IG, which focuses on sharing clinical data. Together, they enable a more holistic view of patient information.
* **Privacy and Security:** The IG emphasizes strong security and privacy measures, including TLS encryption, SMART on FHIR authorization, and audit logging, to safeguard sensitive patient data.
* **Improving Interoperability:** The IG encourages payers to provide human-readable descriptions for coded data elements and to use resource-level text for better rendering of EOB information. This helps app developers present the data in a user-friendly manner.

This IG represents a significant step towards empowering patients with control over their healthcare data, enabling them to leverage third-party applications for better management of their health and finances.
