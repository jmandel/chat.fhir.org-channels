# Vital Records Common Profiles Library: Analysis

## 1. Objectives 

This implementation guide (IG) aims to standardize the way digital birth, death, and fetal death records are structured and shared between different computer systems. It seeks to make these records consistent and easy to understand across various health information systems, reducing the burden on healthcare providers and improving data exchange between public health agencies. 

## 2. Previous Approaches and Limitations 

The IG mentions that before its development, there was a lack of consistency in how vital records information was represented in different systems, leading to redundancy and difficulty in exchanging data. Specifically:

*  The Birth and Fetal Death Reporting (BFDR), Vital Records Death Reporting (VRDR), and Medicolegal and Death Investigation (MDI) IGs had overlapping and inconsistently defined data elements. 
*  There was a reliance on the Public Health Information Network Vocabulary Access and Distribution System (PHIN VADS) for codes and value sets, which may not be accessible to all systems. 
*  The handling of "edit flags," which indicate data quality issues, was not standardized. 

## 3.  Technical Approach 

The IG introduces a standardized set of profiles, extensions, code systems, and value sets to be used across all vital records systems. This includes:

*  **Profiles:** These define the structure and content of specific FHIR resources, such as Patient, Location, and Observation, tailored for vital records data.
*  **Extensions:** These add additional data elements to existing FHIR resources to capture information specific to vital records, like partial dates and city codes.
*  **Code Systems:** These define standard codes for various vital records concepts, such as race, ethnicity, and education level.
*  **Value Sets:** These group together related codes from code systems, providing a controlled vocabulary for specific data elements.

By defining these standardized artifacts, the IG ensures that vital records data is represented consistently across different systems, facilitating interoperability.

## 4. Scope, Design Choices, and Context 

Key decisions and factors influencing the design of the IG include:

*  **Focus on Reuse:** The IG is designed as a library of common elements to be reused by other, more specific IGs (BFDR, VRDR, MDI).
*  **Alignment with US Core:** The IG leverages the US Core specification where possible, ensuring compatibility with a widely adopted standard.
*  **Support for "Edit Flags":** The IG incorporates a standardized approach to handling edit flags, improving data quality and validation processes.
*  **Inclusion of Local Code Systems:**  The IG defines its own code systems and value sets for some vital records concepts, reducing reliance on external systems like PHIN VADS.
*  **Interoperability with IJE:** The IG ensures that all data elements from the Interjurisdictional Exchange (IJE) format can be represented in FHIR, enabling seamless data exchange.

These choices reflect the IG's goal of creating a robust, flexible, and interoperable framework for the exchange of digital vital records.
