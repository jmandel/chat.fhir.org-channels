The "MyPatient" IG aims to enhance the sharing and utilization of health and human services data by creating a more comprehensive view of an individual's needs.  Traditionally, healthcare data and information about social service needs like housing or food assistance have been stored separately, making it difficult to gain a complete understanding of a person's well-being. This IG seeks to address this issue by utilizing FHIR, a widely adopted framework for exchanging healthcare information electronically. By extending FHIR to encompass social service data, the IG enables a more holistic approach to care. The "MyPatient" profile likely builds upon the standard FHIR "Patient" resource to include relevant social service information. This initiative aligns with broader efforts by the US Department of Health and Human Services to improve data sharing across health and human services, including developing new data standards and addressing existing gaps. While the IG leverages the benefits of an established standard like FHIR, it also acknowledges the complexities of implementing it within social service settings and offers guidance to address these challenges.
