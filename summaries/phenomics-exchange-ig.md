The GA4GH Phenopackets FHIR IG aims to improve how EHRs store and share information about patient characteristics, especially for individuals with rare diseases. It achieves this by using FHIR, which allows different computer systems to easily understand and exchange data. This IG focuses on creating detailed descriptions of a patient's observable traits, like symptoms or physical features, which are crucial for diagnosing rare diseases. It uses a specific coding system called the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) to represent these traits in a way that computers can analyze. By structuring this information consistently, the IG enables researchers and clinicians to share and compare patient data more effectively, potentially leading to faster and more accurate diagnoses. The IG also aims to integrate with other data standards, such as those used in cancer research, to promote broader data sharing and collaboration. This effort is expected to facilitate research and ultimately improve the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases by making it easier to analyze patient information and compare it with existing knowledge about diseases and their associated characteristics.
