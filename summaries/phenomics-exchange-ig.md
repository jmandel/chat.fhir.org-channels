**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems use and share information about patients' observable characteristics, called phenotypes, especially for people with rare diseases.

The GA4GH Phenopacket FHIR Implementation Guide defines how to use the FHIR standard to record and exchange detailed phenotypic information. It focuses on supporting the diagnosis and research of rare diseases.

This guide addresses the need for a standardized way to represent complex patient characteristics, going beyond simple diagnoses. It allows healthcare providers to record details like the age of onset, severity, and specific traits associated with a patient's condition. This comprehensive information can then be used to support more accurate diagnoses, particularly for rare diseases where identifying the underlying cause can be challenging.

The guide leverages the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), a standardized vocabulary for describing phenotypic abnormalities. Using HPO terms ensures that information is recorded consistently and can be understood by computer systems, enabling more powerful analysis and comparison of patient data. This can aid in identifying similar cases, discovering potential genetic links, and advancing research into rare diseases.

While the guide primarily focuses on rare diseases, its principles can be applied to other areas of healthcare where detailed phenotypic information is valuable. By promoting consistent and computable representation of patient characteristics, this guide contributes to better data sharing and ultimately improved patient care.
