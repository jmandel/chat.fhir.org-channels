**TL;DR:** This guide defines a standard way to use technology to ask for changes to your medical records, track the progress of your request, and record any disagreements if your request is denied.

The FHIR Patient Correction Implementation Guide (IG) aims to improve the process of requesting corrections to medical records. Currently, this process is often slow and involves paper forms or phone calls. This IG offers a way to make these requests electronically using a standard format called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). 

This IG focuses on how patients can send correction requests to their healthcare providers and how providers can respond. It includes a method for patients to track the status of their requests â€“ whether it's being reviewed, accepted, or denied. It also provides a way for patients to formally record their disagreement if a correction is denied.

The IG covers different scenarios, from simple corrections like updating smoking status to more complex situations. It handles various communication flows, from acknowledging the initial request to informing the patient about the final decision. It's important to note that this guide doesn't automatically change the records. Healthcare providers still need to review and manually update the information.

This guide is intended to work across different regions and considers regulations like HIPAA and GDPR, which protect patient privacy and give them the right to correct their data. The goal is to make it easier and more efficient for both patients and providers to handle medical record corrections, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable health information.
