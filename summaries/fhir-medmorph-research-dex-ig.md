The MedMorph Research Data Exchange IG defines a standardized way to share patient data for research, specifically between healthcare organizations (data sources) and research networks (data marts). It aims to simplify the process of adding new data partners to research networks by creating a consistent method for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data. Previously, variations in data formats and transfer methods made this onboarding process complex and time-consuming, taking anywhere from weeks to months. This IG leverages the FHIR standard, building upon existing standards like the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) and the Common Data Model for Healthcare (CDMH). It defines specific data elements to be shared, uses SMART on FHIR for secure data access, and employs knowledge artifacts to guide the ETL process, which is automated by the Health Data Exchange Application. While the IG focuses on exchanging large sets of structured patient data for research, it does not cover aspects like state and local data sharing policies, data quality checks, or the use of unstructured data like images. It was developed collaboratively by several organizations to address the challenges research networks face in efficiently onboarding data partners and accessing the data they need.
