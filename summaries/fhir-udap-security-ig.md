**TL;DR:** This guide helps apps securely access and share your health information between different healthcare organizations, like your doctor's office and your insurance company.

The FHIR UDAP Security Implementation Guide (IG) defines a standard way for apps to connect to systems that hold health information, like electronic health records. It focuses on making sure these connections are secure and that only authorized apps can access your data.

This guide addresses the need for better security and trust when sharing health information electronically. It does this by outlining specific steps for apps to register and prove their identity, similar to how you might need to log in with a username and password. It also describes how apps can ask for permission to access specific parts of your health information, like your allergies or medications.

For situations where you might need to use an app that connects to multiple healthcare systems, this guide also defines a way for those systems to securely verify your identity. This can be helpful if, for example, your doctor's office needs to access information from your insurance company.

This guide does not cover all aspects of health information security, but it provides a strong foundation for building secure and trustworthy apps that can access and share your health data. It's important to note that this guide focuses on the technical details of how apps connect and exchange information, not on the specific policies or regulations that govern the use of your health data. Those policies are typically determined by your healthcare provider, insurance company, or other organizations that hold your information.
