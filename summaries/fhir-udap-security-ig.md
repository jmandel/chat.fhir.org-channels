The UDAP Security IG aims to standardize and enhance the security of health information exchange between different healthcare organizations and applications, including those used by patients and providers. It achieves this by establishing a common set of rules for how apps verify their identity, register with systems they need to connect with, and manage user authorization. Instead of relying on simple passwords, the guide promotes the use of robust methods like digital certificates and encryption keys for stronger security. It also enables automated app registration, streamlining the process of connecting apps to health systems. The guide supports different types of apps, addressing the needs of both patient-facing apps and those used for communication between organizations. Additionally, it enables users to leverage their existing logins from one organization to access data held by another, when authorized. The IG builds upon previous efforts and aligns with national initiatives to promote secure health data exchange. It is designed to work with existing frameworks like SMART App Launch and accommodates different levels of trust between organizations. While it focuses on specific methods for authorization, it allows for flexibility in how certain data elements are represented.
