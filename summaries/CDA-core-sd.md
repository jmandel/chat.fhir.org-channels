This IG aims to improve the sharing and understanding of clinical documents, such as medical records, between different EHR systems. It achieves this by leveraging FHIR to represent the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), a widely used format for clinical documents. The guide provides a way to structure these documents using a standardized language called Extensible Markup Language (XML) and links the information within them to a common medical model, ensuring that different systems interpret the data consistently. While the guide facilitates validation and querying of CDA documents using FHIR tools, it's important to note that it doesn't replace CDA itself. Clinical Document Architecture remains the primary standard, and understanding it is still necessary. The guide acknowledges that CDA is designed for human readability and offers flexibility for extensions to accommodate specific needs. It also emphasizes the importance of backward compatibility, security, and the ongoing efforts to achieve complete understanding of the meaning of clinical information across systems. The guide serves as a bridge between existing CDA practices and newer FHIR-based approaches, potentially enabling smoother exchange and processing of clinical data.
