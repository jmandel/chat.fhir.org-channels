The "uv-dx-pq" IG aims to improve how the biopharmaceutical industry manages and shares information about drug quality. Currently, this data is often stored in unstructured documents like Word files and PDFs, making it difficult to access, analyze, and exchange efficiently. This IG proposes a new approach using a standardized, machine-readable format called FHIR. By structuring quality data into specific categories and using FHIR resources, the IG enables easier data exchange between different software systems within and across organizations. This structured approach could streamline processes like drug development and manufacturing, although the guide primarily focuses on data exchange within the industry and is not intended for regulatory submissions. The IG prioritizes practical examples and aligns with international standards like ISO IDMP to ensure compatibility with other systems. While it does not define strict rules for data formatting, it offers a flexible framework that can be adapted to various needs.
