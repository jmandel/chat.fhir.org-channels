**TL;DR:** This guide helps medical examiners and coroners share information about deaths with other organizations. 

The Medicolegal Death Investigation (MDI) Implementation Guide defines how medical examiners and coroners can use a standardized format called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) to electronically exchange information about deaths. This guide focuses on two main data flows:

* **Sharing death investigation findings with death registration systems:** This allows medical examiners and coroners to send information about the cause and manner of death, decedent demographics, and other details to the agencies responsible for registering deaths. This electronic exchange replaces paper-based processes, making it faster and more efficient.
* **Receiving toxicology results from laboratories:** This enables medical examiners and coroners to receive lab results electronically, eliminating delays associated with paper or fax-based reporting. This helps expedite death investigations and ensures that all relevant information is readily available. 

The MDI guide ensures that different computer systems used by medical examiners, coroners, labs, and death registration agencies can understand and share information. This standardization promotes better communication, faster investigations, and improved data quality in death investigation and reporting.
