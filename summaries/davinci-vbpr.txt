**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare providers and payers share information about how well the provider is caring for their patients.

The Da Vinci Value-Based Performance Reporting Implementation Guide (IG) improves communication between healthcare providers and payers about patient care quality and costs in value-based care agreements. These agreements offer financial rewards to providers for meeting certain performance goals, like making sure patients get recommended preventive screenings or managing chronic conditions effectively.

This guide defines a standard way to share performance data using a format called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources).  It helps providers understand their performance in areas like:

- **Quality of care:** How well the provider is meeting specific quality measures, such as breast cancer screening rates or blood sugar control for patients with diabetes.
- **Cost of care:** How the provider's costs for patient care compare to agreed-upon targets. 
- **Utilization:** How often patients use healthcare services, such as hospital admissions or emergency room visits.

By standardizing this reporting process, the IG aims to reduce administrative burden on providers, who often receive data in different formats from various payers. It also promotes transparency and helps both providers and payers track progress toward value-based care goals.

This version of the IG focuses on reports sent from payers to providers. Future versions may address data flowing from providers back to payers.
