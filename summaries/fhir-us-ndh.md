The National Directory of Healthcare Providers & Services (NDH) IG seeks to create a nationwide, unified source of information about healthcare providers and services in the US. It addresses the problems of fragmented and outdated provider directories by leveraging FHIR. This format enables consistent organization and exchange of healthcare information, making it easier for different computer systems to communicate. The guide defines how to structure data elements like provider names, contact information, services offered, insurance networks, and electronic addresses. It also offers guidance on how providers can submit their information, how the directory can verify the accuracy of that information, and how others can access and utilize it. The NDH IG aims to improve the accuracy and accessibility of healthcare provider data, ultimately benefiting patients, providers, and other healthcare stakeholders by streamlining processes like finding providers, coordinating care, and verifying insurance coverage. The guide focuses specifically on the US healthcare system and builds upon existing standards and initiatives. While it outlines a comprehensive approach, it doesn't mandate a specific technical setup for the directory, allowing for flexibility in implementation.
