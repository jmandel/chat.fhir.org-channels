The EBMonFHIR IG seeks to improve how computers understand and share scientific knowledge, particularly in healthcare. It addresses limitations of older methods like traditional citations, which lack flexibility and machine-readability. This IG leverages FHIR, a framework for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It defines new FHIR structures for representing research articles, datasets, and other scientific materials, along with details about research studies and their findings. The IG also standardizes terminology for describing research methods and concepts, making it easier for computers to analyze and compare information from different sources. While it aims to support a wide range of research designs and evidence-based medicine principles, the EBMonFHIR IG is still under development and may not cover all potential use cases. It strives for compatibility with different FHIR versions to ensure smooth information exchange between systems. The guide focuses on representing scientific knowledge in a computable format, enabling automated analysis and potentially supporting decision-making based on the best available evidence.
