**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems share information about medicines and medical devices in a standardized way.

The FHIR Order Catalog Implementation Guide (IG) defines how to create and exchange catalogs of medications and medical devices using the FHIR standard. These catalogs can be used by healthcare providers, patients, and other systems to find detailed information about available products.

This IG helps solve the problem of inconsistent product information across different systems. By using a standard format, healthcare providers can be sure they are getting accurate information about the medicines and devices they prescribe. This can help reduce errors and improve patient safety.

The IG defines specific profiles for representing different types of information, such as the name, description, intended use, and packaging of a product. It also defines ways to search for products within a catalog, for example, by name, model number, or classification.

This IG is relevant for healthcare providers who prescribe medications and devices, organizations that manage product catalogs, and developers who build systems that interact with these catalogs. It aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of information exchange in the healthcare ecosystem.

While the IG provides a detailed framework for representing product information, it doesn't cover every possible scenario. For example, it doesn't specify how to handle pricing information or regulatory approvals. These aspects may be addressed in future versions of the IG or in other related standards.

By promoting the use of standardized catalogs, this IG can help improve the quality and safety of healthcare by ensuring that accurate and consistent product information is available to all stakeholders.
