This IG aims to standardize how healthcare providers share information about a patient's functional status, including activities like moving around, self-care, and managing household chores. Sharing this information is especially important during transitions between care settings, such as from a hospital to a nursing home. The guide uses FHIR to structure this information, making it easier for different EHR systems to exchange it. Specifically, it defines what data elements to collect, such as a patient's ability to walk or dress themselves, and uses standard codes for consistent representation. Initially, the guide focuses on sharing functional status information when patients transition to post-acute care settings like skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies. It utilizes a secure method for exchanging information, ensuring patient privacy. The guide's approach is designed to be adaptable and expandable, allowing it to accommodate different types of assessments and future advancements in how we understand and measure functional status.
