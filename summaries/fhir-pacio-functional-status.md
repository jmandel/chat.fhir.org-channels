**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare providers share information about a patient's ability to perform daily tasks.

The PACIO Functional Status Implementation Guide focuses on exchanging observations about a person's mobility, self-care, and ability to manage daily life (like housework or finances). This information is crucial for coordinating care, especially when a patient moves between different healthcare settings, such as hospitals, nursing facilities, and home health agencies. 

The guide addresses the need for complete and accurate information about a patient's functional status to be available to all healthcare providers involved in their care. This helps to avoid inefficient workflows, duplicate data entry, and potential patient harm due to missing information. 

The guide provides a standardized way to exchange this information using FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). It defines data elements and coding standards to ensure that the information can be understood and used by different computer systems. This allows healthcare providers to access a patient's functional status history, track their progress, and make more informed decisions about their care.
