**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems share data about patients hospitalized with respiratory viruses like the flu, COVID-19, and RSV with public health organizations.

The Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) Content Implementation Guide (IG) defines how healthcare systems can electronically report data about patients hospitalized with respiratory viruses. This data helps public health organizations track and respond to outbreaks of these viruses.

**How it works:** The guide focuses on using a specific app called the Health Data Exchange App (HDEA) to gather and send data to RESP-NET sites. It leverages existing standards like the US Core profiles and the MedMorph Reference Architecture to ensure data is shared in a consistent and secure way.

The guide outlines what data should be shared, including patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and lab results. It also defines the technical requirements for systems that want to share this data, including how they should handle patient authorization and data security.

**Benefits:** Automating this reporting process can reduce the burden on healthcare providers, improve the timeliness of data sharing, and ultimately help public health organizations better track and respond to outbreaks of respiratory viruses.

**Limitations:** The guide does not cover all aspects of respiratory virus surveillance. For example, it does not address how to assess the quality of the data being shared or how to collect consent from patients for data sharing. 

This guide is an important step towards improving public health surveillance of respiratory viruses. By making it easier for healthcare systems to share data electronically, we can get a better understanding of these viruses and how to protect people from them.

**Important terms:**

* **FHIR:** A standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically.
* **HDEA:** An app that helps healthcare systems share data with public health organizations.
* **US Core profiles:** A set of standards that define what data should be shared in different healthcare scenarios.
* **MedMorph Reference Architecture:** A framework for building healthcare data exchange systems.
