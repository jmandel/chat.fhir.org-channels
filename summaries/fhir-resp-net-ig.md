The RESP-NET Content IG defines a standardized way for healthcare facilities to electronically report data about patients hospitalized with respiratory viruses like influenza, COVID-19, and RSV to public health agencies participating in the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET). The IG aims to replace the current manual processes of identifying and collecting data on these cases, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. It leverages the FHIR standard to specify the required data elements, automate data extraction and reporting, and ensure secure data exchange. The process involves RESP-NET sites defining their reporting requirements, the MedMorph Health Data Exchange App (HDEA) setting up automated data extraction from EHRs based on those requirements, and the HDEA securely transmitting the extracted data to the appropriate RESP-NET site. This IG focuses specifically on hospitalized patients with certain respiratory viruses within the RESP-NET surveillance area and addresses data elements currently collected by RESP-NET. It does not cover aspects like data quality assessment or consent policies, and its effectiveness depends on the increasing adoption of EHR systems that support FHIR.
