This IG addresses challenges in how healthcare software systems describe their capabilities when exchanging information using FHIR. Currently, the FHIR CapabilityStatement, which lists what a system can do, is becoming overly complex and lacks detail. This IG introduces a new approach called the Application Feature Framework. Instead of just basic descriptions, systems can now use a predefined set of "features" – essentially codes that represent specific functions – and their associated values to describe what they can do. This allows systems to directly ask each other about specific features using a new operation called "$feature-query," and it enables automatic compatibility checks before data exchange. The framework relies on standardized terminology to ensure all systems understand the features in the same way. While this approach offers a more efficient and detailed way to describe system capabilities, it also necessitates that systems negotiate which features they require before exchanging information, as they may not list all features by default. The framework is designed to be flexible, allowing features to describe capabilities at different levels of detail, and it can be extended to include new features as needed.
