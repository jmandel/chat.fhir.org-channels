The Terminology Fundamentals IG aims to improve how healthcare systems define and manage sets of medical codes, such as those used for diagnoses or lab tests. These sets, known as "Value Sets," are crucial for ensuring that different computer systems understand and use the same codes consistently. This IG introduces a standardized way to create and describe Value Sets, including details about their purpose, scope, and the specific codes they contain. It provides a clear, machine-readable format for defining these sets, allowing automated systems to generate and update the lists of codes as needed. The IG also emphasizes the importance of reusing Value Sets to ensure consistency across different healthcare organizations and systems. While it focuses on defining these sets and does not cover all aspects of code management, it offers a significant step towards better standardization and interoperability in healthcare information exchange. The guide acknowledges that code systems evolve over time and provides mechanisms for managing these changes to maintain the accuracy and relevance of Value Sets.
