This IG helps healthcare systems exchange information even if they use different data formats. It focuses on translating data from HL7 Version 2 (v2) into FHIR. The guide provides detailed instructions on how to map or connect specific pieces of information from v2 to their corresponding parts in FHIR. This is done through spreadsheets that are then turned into computer-readable instructions. The guide concentrates on the most common types of v2 messages and data elements, allowing older systems to share data with newer systems that use FHIR. It covers various aspects of data translation, including matching medical terms between the two formats. While it primarily focuses on the initial conversion to FHIR, it acknowledges that further steps might be needed depending on how the receiving system uses the data. The guide also recognizes that some aspects, like managing patient identities and handling unique local data elements, might require custom solutions depending on the specific needs of each healthcare system.
