The QI-Core IG aims to standardize healthcare data for quality improvement initiatives, such as measuring hospital performance or providing doctors with alerts about best practices within EHRs. QI-Core leverages the FHIR standard and builds upon the US Core, a set of FHIR profiles specific to the US healthcare system. QI-Core focuses on how data is structured, using profiles to specify the format of FHIR resources, extensions to add necessary information for quality measures and clinical decision support, and standardized terminology to ensure consistent coding of medical concepts. It addresses challenges posed by previous, separate data models by creating a common structure, which can streamline the development of tools that both measure healthcare quality and support clinical decisions. While QI-Core primarily aligns with US standards, it acknowledges the need for broader applicability. The guide focuses on essential data elements for interoperability and includes a standardized approach to representing the absence of a medical action, which is crucial for accurate quality assessment. It is important to note that QI-Core focuses on data representation and does not define the logic for quality measures or decision support rules themselves.
