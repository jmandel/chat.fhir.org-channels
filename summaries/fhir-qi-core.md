**TL;DR:** This guide helps improve how computer systems share information about your health to support better healthcare decisions.

The Quality Improvement Core (QI-Core) Implementation Guide defines a common way to represent your health data for quality improvement activities like measuring healthcare performance and providing clinical decision support. It builds upon the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) standard and ensures that computer systems can exchange information about things like allergies, medications, procedures, and observations in a consistent way.

The guide helps healthcare providers and organizations better understand what information is needed for quality measurement and clinical decision support. It also provides guidance on how to represent information about when a particular treatment or service was not provided and the reason why, which is important for understanding the full picture of a patient's care.

QI-Core focuses on representing clinical data used in quality improvement and does not include information about specific quality measures or decision support tools. It also does not specify how these systems should be built or implemented. The guide is primarily focused on the US healthcare system but much of the content is likely to be useful in other countries as well.
