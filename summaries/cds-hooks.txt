**TL;DR:** This guide helps computer systems share information about patient care decisions, like medicine suggestions and treatment plans.

The CDS Hooks Implementation Guide (IG) defines a standard way for electronic health records (EHRs) and other clinical systems to get advice from decision support services at specific points in a patient's care. This advice can include things like suggesting a different medication dose, warning about potential drug interactions, or recommending a specific treatment plan. 

This guide addresses the need for healthcare systems to seamlessly integrate with decision support tools. It does this by defining "hooks," which are specific events in a patient's care where advice might be needed, like when a doctor is writing a prescription or viewing a patient's chart.  The guide also describes how these systems can share information securely and efficiently, ensuring that the decision support services have the data they need to give helpful advice.

The guide also addresses the need for feedback on the advice given. It defines a way for healthcare systems to tell the decision support services whether their advice was accepted, overridden, or ignored. This feedback helps the decision support services learn and improve their advice over time.

CDS Hooks is designed to be flexible and can be used with different types of decision support services. It can also be extended to support new types of hooks and data as needed. This flexibility helps ensure that CDS Hooks can be used to improve patient care in a variety of settings.

By using the CDS Hooks standard, healthcare systems can more easily integrate with decision support services, which can help improve the quality and safety of patient care.
