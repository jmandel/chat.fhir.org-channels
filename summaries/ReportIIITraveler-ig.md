This IG focuses on improving how public health officials share information about travelers who become sick with contagious diseases, particularly during air travel. It establishes a standardized, digital format for exchanging this information, making it easier to track and control the spread of diseases. Previously, this information was often shared manually and without a consistent format, leading to delays and challenges, especially during large-scale outbreaks. This guide leverages FHIR to define how information about the sick traveler, their flight, and potential disease should be structured and shared electronically. It also aims to integrate with existing systems used by public health agencies, such as the CDC's central data platform. The guide prioritizes collaboration with various stakeholders, including health experts and technology providers, to ensure it addresses real-world needs. It acknowledges the importance of data security and plans to address it in alignment with established guidelines. The guide's scope is primarily on air travel and aims to support both basic and detailed reports, offering flexibility for different situations. It's important to note that this guide focuses on establishing a standardized approach and doesn't itself prevent or eliminate disease outbreaks.
