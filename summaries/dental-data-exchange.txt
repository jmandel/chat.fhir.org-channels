**TL;DR:** This guide helps dentists and doctors share patient information electronically in a standardized way.

The HL7 FHIRÂ® R4 Implementation Guide: Dental Data Exchange aims to standardize how medical and dental providers share patient information electronically. This guide focuses on dental referrals and consultation notes, enabling better communication between dentists and doctors. 

Currently, dentists and doctors often rely on paper forms, faxes, or emails to exchange patient information, which can be slow and inefficient. This guide encourages the use of electronic health records (EHRs) and electronic dental records (EDRs) to exchange key data elements electronically, improving care coordination and reducing administrative burden.

The guide provides detailed instructions on how to structure dental information using FHIR resources, ensuring that different computer systems can understand and process the data. It also addresses specific use cases, such as a medical provider referring a patient to a dentist or a dentist sending a consult note back to a doctor. By promoting standardized data exchange, this guide aims to improve patient care, enhance communication between healthcare providers, and support better-informed treatment decisions.
