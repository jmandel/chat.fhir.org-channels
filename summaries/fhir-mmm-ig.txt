**TL;DR:** This guide helps researchers study information about mothers and their babies to improve healthcare for both.

The Longitudinal Maternal & Child Health Information for Research FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) lets maternal health researchers collect and study clinical information about mothers and babies. This helps researchers find the reasons for health problems during and after pregnancy and how they affect both mothers and children. The guide focuses on information from pregnancy, labor and delivery, and the time after birth. It also includes how to link a mother's health records with her baby's records.

**How it helps:**

* **Standardizes data:** The guide helps researchers get information from different places like hospitals and clinics in a consistent way, making it easier to study and compare.
* **Links mother and child data:** The guide shows how to connect a mother's health records with her baby's records. This is important because a mother's health can affect her baby's health, and vice versa.
* **Supports research on specific health issues:** This guide initially focuses on high blood pressure during pregnancy and deaths that happen within a year of pregnancy. In the future, it will also help researchers study other issues like the effects of medicine taken during pregnancy on babies, how a mother's past pregnancies can affect her current baby, and how work can affect pregnancy and infant health. 
* **Helps researchers find ways to improve healthcare:** By making it easier to study health information, this guide can help researchers find ways to prevent health problems and improve care for mothers and babies.

**Who can use it:**

This guide is mainly for people who create computer systems for hospitals and clinics, researchers, and people who analyze health information. It can also be helpful for policymakers who want to understand how to use health information to improve healthcare.
