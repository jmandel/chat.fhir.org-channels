The DaVinci PDex US Drug Formulary IG aims to create a standardized way for health insurers in the US to share drug formulary information electronically using FHIR. A drug formulary is a list of prescription medications that a health insurance plan will cover. This IG seeks to improve the way patients and consumers access and understand drug formulary information, enabling them to compare costs and coverage details across different insurance plans and potentially find more affordable medication options. It addresses limitations of previous methods like PDF documents and website drug search forms by defining specific data structures and standardized ways to search and exchange formulary data. The IG leverages RxNorm codes to identify drugs uniquely and supports both authenticated access for members viewing their plan's formulary and unauthenticated access for consumers comparing plans. It acknowledges the variability in how drug tiers and pharmacy benefit types are defined across different payers and offers flexibility while promoting standardization. While the IG aims to provide detailed coverage information, it does not address the complexities of identifying therapeutic alternatives or provide precise, individual-level cost estimates, as actual costs can vary.
