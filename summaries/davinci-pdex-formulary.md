**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare providers exchange information about prescription drug formularies.

The DaVinci Payer Data Exchange (PDex) US Drug Formulary Implementation Guide defines a standard way to exchange information about prescription drug formularies using the FHIR standard. A drug formulary is a list of prescription drugs that a health insurance plan will cover.

This guide is intended for use by health insurers in the United States. It enables them to share their formularies with patients, consumers, and other healthcare providers in a consistent and machine-readable format. This can help patients understand the costs of their medications and find lower-cost alternatives. It can also help consumers compare drug coverage across different insurance plans.

The guide defines specific data elements that must be included in a formulary, such as the drug name, dosage form, and tier level. It also defines how to represent coverage rules, such as prior authorization requirements and quantity limits. In addition, the guide provides guidance on how to search for drugs within a formulary.

It is important to note that the cost-sharing information in a formulary may not be exact. The actual cost of a medication may vary depending on the pharmacy and the patient's individual benefits. Patients should always consult with their healthcare provider and pharmacist to get the most accurate information about their medication costs.
