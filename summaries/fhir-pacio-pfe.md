The "FHIR Patient Assessment and Care Outcomes (PACIO) Post-Acute Functioning and Engagement" IG defines a standardized way to electronically share information about a patient's ability to perform daily activities and participate in their community. This includes details about physical abilities (like walking or eating), cognitive abilities (like memory or communication), and the support a patient needs to live independently. The IG uses the FHIR standard to structure this information. It leverages the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) categories to organize the data and make it easier to understand. The guide focuses on sharing this information between different healthcare providers, especially those in post-acute care settings like nursing homes and home health agencies, but does not specify how the information should be collected or displayed in EHR systems. The goal is to improve care coordination by ensuring that healthcare providers have access to complete and accurate information about a patient's functional abilities, which can lead to better care transitions and reduce the need to repeat assessments. This IG is particularly relevant because of legislation that mandates the standardization of patient assessments in post-acute care.
