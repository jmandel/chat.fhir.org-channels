**TL;DR:** This guide helps patients access and share their health insurance claims data.

The CARIN Consumer Directed Payer Data Exchange Implementation Guide (also known as the CARIN IG for Blue ButtonÂ® Implementation Guide) defines how patients can access and share their health insurance claims data using a standardized format called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). 

This guide addresses a key requirement of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule, which mandates that health insurance plans provide patients with easy access to their claims and encounter data. It defines how this information is structured and shared through a secure API (application programming interface), enabling patients to view and share their data with third-party applications of their choosing.

The guide focuses on the financial aspects of patient data, including claims information, adjudication details, and payment breakdowns. It specifies how data elements from the Common Payer Consumer Data Set (CPCDS), a standardized set of health insurance data, are mapped to FHIR resources. This ensures that patient data can be easily understood and processed by different computer systems.

By using this guide, health insurance plans can enable patients to access their claims data, understand their healthcare expenses, and share their information with applications that can help them manage their health and finances.
