This IG defines a standard way to use the Clinical Quality Language (CQL) with FHIR to represent and share rules for processing EHR. It aims to improve consistency and interoperability in healthcare by ensuring that different computer systems can understand and apply the same logic when analyzing patient data. The guide achieves this by packaging CQL rules as FHIR "Library" resources, clearly defining the data needed to apply these rules, and leveraging FHIR profiles for detailed data modeling. It also addresses practical challenges like handling missing information and managing changes to rules over time. While the IG focuses on quality measures, its principles are broadly applicable to various healthcare scenarios. It assumes familiarity with CQL and FHIR and emphasizes the importance of standardized terminologies. However, the effectiveness of this approach relies on widespread adoption and consistent implementation across different healthcare systems.
