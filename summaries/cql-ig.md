**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems use a special language to make decisions about patient care.

The "Using CQL with FHIR" Implementation Guide (IG) defines how to use a language called Clinical Quality Language (CQL) with FHIR, a standard for exchanging healthcare information. This guide is like a rulebook for creating and sharing instructions that help computers make decisions about patient care. 

CQL can be used to express medical knowledge in a way that computers can understand. For example, it can be used to define rules for identifying patients who need certain tests or treatments. This guide explains how to write CQL instructions and how to package them in a way that healthcare systems can easily use. It also describes how to use CQL with FHIR profiles, which are sets of rules that define how healthcare information should be structured.

By following this guide, healthcare systems can ensure that their CQL instructions are consistent and can be shared and used by others. This can help to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare.
