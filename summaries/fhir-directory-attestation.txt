**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems share information about doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers.

The National Healthcare Directory Attestation and Verification Implementation Guide defines a common way for healthcare organizations to exchange verified information about healthcare providers. This information includes details about doctors, nurses, hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and other healthcare services. 

The guide focuses on establishing a central source of validated provider data. It allows healthcare providers to submit information about themselves (attestation) and describes how this information can be checked for accuracy (verification). The guide also outlines how this verified data can be shared with other healthcare systems for tasks like finding doctors, making referrals, and checking insurance coverage.

While the guide encourages making much of this information public, it recognizes the need to protect sensitive data, such as the location of domestic violence shelters. It includes ways to restrict access to this information and ensures it is only shared with authorized users.

By establishing a common language and process for sharing verified healthcare provider data, this guide aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of healthcare operations. This can help patients find the right providers, simplify insurance processes, and streamline communication between different parts of the healthcare system.
