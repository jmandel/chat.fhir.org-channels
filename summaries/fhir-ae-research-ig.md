The Adverse Event Research IG aims to standardize the collection and exchange of adverse event (AE) information in clinical research. It achieves this by establishing a common format for representing AE data, regardless of its source, such as EHRs or patient-reported outcomes. This standardization facilitates easier sharing of AE information between different systems used in research, including those used by hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory agencies. The IG leverages the FHIR standard to create a specific profile for representing AEs, defining necessary data elements and their format to ensure consistency. It also outlines potential workflows for collecting and reporting AEs during clinical trials and post-market surveillance. While the IG promotes interoperability and considers regulatory requirements, it acknowledges the need for future expansion, particularly regarding integration with the FDA's safety reporting program, MedWatch. The IG emphasizes the importance of tailoring the foundational profile to specific use cases and provides real-world examples to demonstrate its practical application.
