**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems consistently collect and share information about side effects that happen during research studies.

The Adverse Event Clinical Research Implementation Guide (IG) provides a standard way to represent information about side effects, also known as adverse events, in clinical research. It defines how this information should be structured and shared electronically using the FHIR standard, which is a way to exchange healthcare information digitally. 

The guide addresses the need for better data collection and reporting of adverse events in clinical trials. By providing a standardized format, it aims to make it easier to collect this information from different sources, such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), and share it with researchers, sponsors, and regulatory agencies like the FDA. This can help improve the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and medical devices.

The guide includes examples of how to represent different types of adverse events, including serious and non-serious events, as well as events related to medications, procedures, and devices. It also defines terms and criteria related to adverse events, such as severity, outcome, and causality.
