The eCR FHIR IG seeks to improve how healthcare providers report cases of certain diseases to public health agencies. It leverages FHIR to create a more efficient and automated reporting process. Traditionally, reporting involved manual methods like fax or online forms, leading to delays and inefficiencies. This IG introduces a standardized approach using FHIR, potentially enabling automated case detection within EHR systems based on diagnosis codes. It defines what information should be included in reports, ensuring consistency and the ability to exchange data seamlessly. The IG also enables public health agencies to send standardized responses back to providers. While it aims for automation, it acknowledges that a phased approach may be necessary, allowing for both automated and manual reporting methods. The IG aligns with existing health data standards in the United States and is a collaborative effort involving various stakeholders. It anticipates future developments to further harmonize FHIR resources for public health reporting.
