This IG addresses the challenge of exchanging health information between systems using different versions of FHIR, such as R4 and R5. It aims to facilitate seamless data sharing by providing a standardized method for translating data elements between these versions. The guide achieves this through comprehensive mapping tables that show the corresponding elements in different FHIR versions for each resource and data type, indicating whether elements are equivalent, modified, or removed/added. Detailed instructions explain how to handle specific mapping scenarios, including changes in data types, cardinality, and terminology. The guide also includes practical examples demonstrating the data transformation process between versions. Developed with input from the FHIR community, the IG prioritizes interoperability between major FHIR versions and will be updated as the FHIR standard evolves. The guide focuses on enabling communication between systems using different FHIR versions, but it does not cover all possible mapping scenarios or address the complexities of migrating entire EHR systems between versions.
