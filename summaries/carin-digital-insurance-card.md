**TL;DR:** This guide helps make it possible to view your health insurance information digitally, like on a phone app or through a scannable code, instead of needing a physical insurance card.

The CARIN for Digital Insurance Card (C4DIC) Implementation Guide defines a standard way for health insurance companies to share the information found on a physical insurance card digitally. This guide uses a technology called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) to structure the information so that it can be understood by different computer systems.

**How does it work?**

This guide creates a standard format for health insurance companies to share your insurance information with apps you might use on your phone or other devices. Instead of carrying a physical insurance card, you could use an app to show your coverage details to your doctor or pharmacy. 

The guide also makes it possible to create a scannable code (like a QR code) that represents your insurance information. You could store this code on your phone or print it out and show it to healthcare providers when needed. The provider can then scan the code to access your insurance details.

**What information is included?**

The guide covers most of the data you would find on a typical insurance card, such as your name, member ID, plan type, insurance company details, and copay amounts. It also addresses how to include images like company logos or barcodes.

**Limitations:**

This guide focuses on displaying insurance card information, not on checking if you are eligible for specific services. It also does not cover all possible data elements that might be found on some insurance cards.

This guide aims to make accessing and sharing your health insurance information easier and more convenient by providing a standard way to do it digitally.
