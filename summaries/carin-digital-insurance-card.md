The CARIN for Digital Insurance Card IG aims to create a standardized way to represent and exchange health insurance information digitally, moving away from traditional physical cards. It leverages FHIR to structure insurance card data, enabling patients to display their information digitally through mobile apps and share verifiable cards with healthcare providers using scannable QR codes or SMART Health Links. This approach addresses challenges associated with physical cards, such as loss, manual data entry errors, and lack of standardization. The IG focuses on common data elements found on United States insurance cards, empowering patients to manage their information while promoting interoperability between healthcare systems. However, it doesn't encompass all possible data elements and primarily caters to the US healthcare context. By using FHIR and SMART Health Cards, the IG aims to ensure secure and verifiable exchange of insurance information while adhering to privacy regulations like HIPAA. The guide acknowledges that it covers the most frequent data elements (80/20 rule) but allows for future expansion through the use of FHIR extensions.
