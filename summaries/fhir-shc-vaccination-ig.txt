**TL;DR:** This guide helps create digital health records for vaccinations and lab tests, making it easier to share this information safely and reliably.

The SMART Health Cards Implementation Guide for Vaccination and Testing describes how to create digital health records for vaccinations and lab tests using the FHIR standard. This makes it easier for patients to share their vaccination and testing information with others, such as schools, employers, or airlines.

The guide focuses on making sure that the information in these digital records is accurate and complete, while also protecting patient privacy. It specifies what information should be included, how it should be formatted, and what codes should be used to identify vaccines and tests.

The guide also addresses the need for data minimization, meaning that only the information that is absolutely necessary should be included in the records. This helps to protect patient privacy and keep the records small enough to be easily shared.

The guide is designed to be used internationally and can be adapted to meet the specific needs of different jurisdictions. It is a valuable resource for healthcare providers, public health agencies, and developers who are working to create and use digital health records for vaccinations and lab tests.
