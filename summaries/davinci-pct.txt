**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare providers and insurance companies exchange cost estimates for medical services using a standard format.

The **Da Vinci Patient Cost Transparency Implementation Guide** provides detailed instructions for healthcare providers and insurance companies to exchange financial information about medical services. This includes sharing good faith estimates (GFEs) with patients and insurance companies, and advanced explanations of benefits (AEOBs) with patients.

The guide helps address the need for patients to understand their potential costs before receiving medical services. It defines how providers can share cost estimates with insurance companies, who can then calculate the patient's expected out-of-pocket costs. The guide also describes how providers can work together to create a single, comprehensive GFE when multiple providers are involved in a patient's care.

This guide leverages the FHIR standard, a widely used format for exchanging healthcare information. Using FHIR helps ensure that different computer systems can understand and process the information, making it easier for providers and insurance companies to share cost estimates. By using this guide, healthcare providers and insurance companies can make the cost of healthcare more transparent for patients, helping them make informed decisions about their care.

The guide focuses on GFEs and AEOBs, and does not address other healthcare processes like eligibility checks, scheduling appointments, or getting prior authorization for services. It also does not cover situations where a patient has more than one insurance plan.
