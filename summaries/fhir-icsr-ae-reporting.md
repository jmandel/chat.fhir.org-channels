This IG focuses on improving the way we report side effects, also known as adverse events, that may occur after receiving biological products like vaccines or blood transfusions. It aims to help EHRs automatically detect these potential side effects and create standardized reports that can be easily sent to regulatory agencies like the FDA. Traditionally, reporting these side effects has been a manual process, leading to underreporting and a lack of detailed information. This guide tackles these issues by providing a two-part solution. First, it offers a set of algorithms that can analyze data within EHRs to identify possible side effects. These algorithms are designed to produce results comparable to those obtained from insurance claims data. Second, the guide defines standardized templates for creating comprehensive reports using FHIR, which enables easy sharing of healthcare information. These templates ensure the reports include all the necessary details required by the FDA. This guide specifically addresses side effects related to vaccinations and blood transfusions, using structured information like diagnosis codes and immunization records from EHRs. It was developed as part of the FDA's Biologics Effectiveness and Safety initiative to enhance the monitoring of the safety of biological products.
