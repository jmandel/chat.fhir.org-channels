**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems better detect and report adverse events (bad reactions) after someone gets a vaccine or a blood transfusion.

The FHIR Implementation Guide for Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) Adverse Event Reporting details a process for finding and reporting adverse events from the information in electronic health records. The guide focuses specifically on adverse events that happen after vaccinations or blood transfusions.

This guide provides a way to automatically detect possible adverse events. It does this by using special computer algorithms that look for patterns in patient data.  Once a possible adverse event is found, a doctor can review the information and decide if it is a real adverse event that needs to be reported. The guide also includes instructions for creating a standardized report that can be sent to the FDA. 

This process can help make sure that more adverse events are reported and that the reports have enough information for the FDA to make decisions about the safety of vaccines and blood products. This guide is part of the FDA's efforts to improve the safety of these important medical products.
