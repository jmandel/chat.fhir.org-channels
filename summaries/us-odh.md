The Occupational Data for Health (ODH) guide aims to create a standard way to represent and share information about a person's work within healthcare systems. It addresses the prior lack of a consistent method for handling work-related information, which could hinder effective healthcare decisions. The guide leverages the HL7 FHIR standard, a modern approach to exchanging healthcare data electronically.  It defines specific data elements and structures, called profiles, for describing various aspects of work, such as job title, industry, and potential hazards. These profiles ensure that different systems can easily understand and share this information. The ODH guide focuses on work-related details relevant to patient care, population health management, and public health reporting, rather than administrative or billing purposes. It was developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) with input from experts in clinical care, public health, and health IT, and it acknowledges that it may include more detailed occupational information than is currently collected in many healthcare systems. By promoting standardized ways to capture and exchange work information, the ODH guide seeks to support better-informed healthcare decisions and potentially improve patient care and public health outcomes.
