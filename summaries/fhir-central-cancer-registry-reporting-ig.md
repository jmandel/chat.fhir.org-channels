**TL;DR:** This guide helps automate the secure sharing of cancer patient information between healthcare providers and central cancer registries.

The Central Cancer Registry Reporting Implementation Guide (IG) defines how electronic health records (EHRs) can automatically send cancer patient information to central cancer registries. These registries collect and analyze data on cancer cases to improve cancer prevention, treatment, and research.

Currently, reporting cancer data to registries is often a manual and time-consuming process. This guide aims to streamline that process by using a standardized format (called FHIR) to electronically package and send the necessary information.

**How it works:**

When a patient is diagnosed with cancer or receives cancer treatment, their EHR system can automatically identify this information. A special app, called the Health Data Exchange App (HDEA), then packages the relevant information into a secure report. This report is then sent to the appropriate central cancer registry, either directly or through a trusted third party. The guide defines what information should be included in the report and how it should be formatted.

**Benefits:**

Automating this process can help ensure that cancer cases are reported more quickly and accurately, leading to better data for research and public health initiatives. It can also reduce the burden on healthcare providers who currently have to manually report this information.

**Limitations:**

This guide focuses on sharing data that is already available in the EHR. It does not define how to validate the data or how to collect data from sources outside the EHR. It also does not address patient consent or privacy concerns, which are handled separately by healthcare providers.

This guide is part of a broader effort to improve the way health information is shared and used. By automating the reporting of cancer data, it can help improve cancer care and research, ultimately benefiting patients and the healthcare system as a whole.
