The Central Cancer Registry Reporting IG defines a standardized way to electronically send cancer case information from healthcare providers like clinics and physician offices to central cancer registries. Historically, this reporting was often done manually, leading to delays and inconsistencies. The IG leverages FHIR to automate and improve this process. Central cancer registries establish the specific criteria for reporting cancer cases, such as the types of cancer and treatments that should trigger a report. These criteria are made available to healthcare providers through a central repository. When a patient encounter in an EHR system meets these criteria, a specialized application extracts the relevant patient information using FHIR application programming interfaces (APIs). This information is then packaged into a standardized report and sent securely to the central cancer registry. The guide focuses on making cancer reporting from ambulatory care settings, where electronic reporting is less common, more efficient and accurate. It also builds upon existing standards and frameworks for healthcare data exchange and emphasizes the importance of complying with patient privacy regulations like HIPAA. By adopting this IG, healthcare providers and registries can move toward a more streamlined and reliable system for reporting cancer cases, which is crucial for effective cancer surveillance and public health initiatives.
