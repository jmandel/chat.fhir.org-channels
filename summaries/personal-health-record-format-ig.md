This IG provides a standard way to develop personal health record (PHR) apps that can easily share information with other health systems. It uses FHIR, which helps different healthcare providers and systems understand patient data. Previously, exchanging patient data was difficult because systems used outdated methods that required custom connections. This IG offers a more efficient approach by suggesting specific ways to organize and share data, like using standard categories for information such as patient demographics, observations, and medical conditions. It also recommends methods for handling large amounts of data and emphasizes the importance of keeping patient information secure. The guide focuses on how to store and exchange data but doesn't dictate specific features for PHR apps. It recognizes the challenges of gathering data from many sources, including doctors, wearable devices, and even social media, while highlighting the need to protect patient privacy and follow laws related to health information.
