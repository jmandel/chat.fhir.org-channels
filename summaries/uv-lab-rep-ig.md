This IG establishes a universal standard for formatting and sharing lab reports, aiming to improve how healthcare systems exchange these crucial documents. It leverages FHIR to define how lab results should be structured and transmitted electronically. The guide offers flexibility by supporting two main approaches: a document-based method, which maintains compatibility with older systems that treat lab reports like signed documents, and a result-oriented method, which simplifies the retrieval of individual results for easier analysis and use. While the guide focuses on common lab tests like blood and urine tests, it does not cover specialized areas such as genetic testing. It builds upon previous efforts to standardize lab reporting and considers various factors, including legal requirements for signed reports and the need to balance document-based approaches with the ability to easily search and access specific lab results. The guide's development involved collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including the IHE PALM community, to ensure alignment with existing standards and practices.
