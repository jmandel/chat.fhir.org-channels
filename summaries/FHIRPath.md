This IG defines FHIRPath, a language designed to access and analyze healthcare data stored using FHIR. Similar to using an address to find a house, FHIRPath provides a standardized way to locate specific pieces of information within complex health records, regardless of how that data is stored. It achieves this by representing the data as a hierarchical structure and allowing users to navigate through it using a simple, chainable syntax. FHIRPath is designed to be easy to read and write, especially when dealing with the repeating elements often found in healthcare data like lists of medications or diagnoses. It can be used in various contexts, including validating the accuracy of data, identifying groups of patients who meet specific criteria, and supporting clinical decision-making. By offering a platform-independent and standardized approach to expressing logic in healthcare data, FHIRPath aims to address the growing need for seamless data exchange and analysis across different healthcare systems and technologies.
