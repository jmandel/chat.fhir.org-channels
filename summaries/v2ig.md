This IG clarifies and updates the HL7 v2 messaging standard, a widely used format for exchanging healthcare information. It aims to make HL7 v2 data types easier to understand and use with modern systems. The guide achieves this by aligning v2 data types with their counterparts in FHIR whenever possible, which helps systems using both standards exchange information more seamlessly. It addresses known issues in the original v2 definitions, such as unclear data type specifications and inconsistencies. The guide focuses on redefining the basic data types of HL7 v2, using FHIR as a model for improvement. While many v2 data types can be directly mapped to FHIR, some require specific rules due to differences between the standards. By clarifying and standardizing v2 data types, this guide aims to improve the interoperability of systems that rely on HL7 v2, particularly as healthcare organizations transition to using FHIR.
