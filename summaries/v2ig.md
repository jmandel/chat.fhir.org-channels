**TL;DR:** This guide helps developers create healthcare applications that can understand and use data formatted according to the HL7 v2 standard, which is commonly used in older healthcare systems. It explains how HL7 v2 data can be represented using the newer FHIR standard, making it easier for different systems to share information.

The HL7 v2+ Implementation Guide (IG) aims to bridge the gap between the older HL7 v2 standard and the newer FHIR standard for exchanging healthcare information. It focuses on defining how common HL7 v2 data types and messages can be represented using FHIR resources, enabling better interoperability between systems that use these different standards.

This IG addresses the need to connect newer applications built using FHIR with older systems that still rely on HL7 v2. By providing a standardized way to represent HL7 v2 data in FHIR, the IG allows these systems to exchange information more easily. This can improve data sharing between hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare providers, leading to better patient care.

For example, the IG explains how an HL7 v2 message containing patient demographics can be transformed into a FHIR Patient resource. It also defines how specific HL7 v2 data types, like dates and coded values, can be mapped to their corresponding FHIR equivalents.

However, it's important to note that not all aspects of HL7 v2 can be perfectly represented in FHIR due to differences between the standards. The IG acknowledges these limitations and provides guidance on how to handle them.

By using this IG, developers can create applications that can effectively communicate with both HL7 v2 and FHIR systems, improving the flow of information across the healthcare ecosystem.
