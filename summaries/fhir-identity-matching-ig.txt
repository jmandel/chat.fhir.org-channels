**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems better match patient records across different organizations, improving data sharing and patient care.

The **FHIR Identity Matching Implementation Guide** defines standards for verifying patient identities and matching patient records across different healthcare organizations. This is important because patient information is often stored in separate systems, making it difficult to get a complete picture of a patient's health history.

The guide provides recommendations for verifying a patient's identity with varying levels of confidence, from basic checks to more rigorous processes involving multiple pieces of evidence. It also suggests ways to match patient records using weighted demographic information, such as name, address, and date of birth.  

By following the standards in this guide, healthcare providers can more accurately match patient records, leading to better-informed care decisions and a more complete understanding of a patientâ€™s health history. This can also help to avoid duplicate records and reduce errors, ultimately improving patient safety and the overall quality of care.
