The CDS Hooks IG aims to standardize how clinical decision support (CDS) tools, which provide doctors with advice during patient care, integrate with EHRs and other health information technology systems. Currently, connecting these tools requires significant custom work, creating expense and compatibility challenges. This IG introduces a new approach called "CDS Hooks," which offers a standardized way for EHRs and CDS tools to communicate. It defines specific points in the EHR workflow, called "hooks," that trigger CDS tools to provide recommendations. When triggered, the EHR sends relevant patient data to the CDS tool, which processes it and returns advice to the EHR for display to the clinician. This approach includes features like a system for CDS tools to advertise their capabilities, the ability for EHRs to provide necessary patient data to the tools, and the use of "cards" to display CDS tool recommendations within the EHR. CDS Hooks emphasizes secure data exchange and aims to be flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of tools and systems. While it promotes easier integration and broader adoption of CDS tools, successful implementation depends on factors like ensuring CDS tools respond quickly and maintaining robust security measures. The IG leverages the FHIR standard for data exchange and is being developed with input from various stakeholders.
