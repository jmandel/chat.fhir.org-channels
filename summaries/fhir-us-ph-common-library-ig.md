The US Public Health Profiles Library is an IG designed to improve how health information is shared for public health purposes in the United States. It does this by creating a standardized set of data elements that can be used by various healthcare systems, EHRs, and public health agencies. Instead of each public health project creating its own unique data format, this library provides a common set that everyone can use. This simplifies the process of sharing information, making it easier to track and respond to health concerns across different systems. The library builds upon existing standards whenever possible and only introduces new data elements when necessary for public health needs. It also provides clear instructions on how these data elements should be used and ensures that they are compatible with existing health information systems. The goal is to make it easier and more efficient to collect, share, and use health information to improve public health outcomes.
