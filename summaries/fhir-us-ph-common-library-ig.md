**TL;DR:** This guide helps public health agencies in the United States use a common set of standards for sharing health information.

The US Public Health Profiles Library (USPHPL) helps different computer systems share important health information with public health agencies. It does this by providing standard definitions for common public health concepts. This makes it easier for healthcare providers, electronic health record companies, and public health agencies to work together. 

The USPHPL works alongside the US Core Implementation Guide (US Core), which is a broader set of standards for healthcare data in the United States. The USPHPL only adds new standards when they are specifically needed for public health purposes. For example, it includes standards for reporting a patient's travel history, pregnancy status, and information about their home environment. 

The goal of the USPHPL is to make it easier to share health information, which can help public health agencies track and respond to outbreaks and other health events more effectively.
