**TL;DR:** This guide defines a way for healthcare providers to easily get copies of payment explanations from insurance companies using a standardized method.

The **Da Vinci Postable Remittance Implementation Guide** defines a standard way for healthcare providers to automatically retrieve copies of remittances (payment explanations) from payers (insurance companies) and clearinghouses. This guide aims to replace current manual processes, such as using payer portals, making phone calls, or sending faxes, which are time-consuming and prone to errors.

Currently, healthcare providers often struggle to obtain remittances for various reasons, including shared Tax Identification Numbers, changes in providers' systems, and issues with claim processing.  This can lead to delays in receiving payments and difficulty reconciling accounts.

This guide addresses these challenges by defining a secure way for providers to request copies of remittances electronically. Providers can search for remittances based on claim information, patient information, or payment details. They can then download a copy of the remittance as a standardized file.

By automating the process of retrieving remittances, this guide aims to reduce manual work for providers and payers, improve the efficiency of payment reconciliation, and potentially decrease days in Accounts Receivable. It also offers a more secure and reliable alternative to traditional methods of obtaining remittances.

It is important to note that the timeframe for retrieving remittances can vary depending on the payer. Payers are expected to provide information about their specific search timeframes. Additionally, the guide addresses privacy and security considerations, emphasizing the need for secure authentication and adherence to relevant regulations.

This guide provides a standardized approach for retrieving remittances, which can lead to significant benefits for both healthcare providers and payers.
