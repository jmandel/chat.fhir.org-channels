**TL;DR:** This guide helps eye doctors share eye exam information between computer systems.

The Eyecare Implementation Guide (IG) aims to improve how electronic health records (EHRs) store and exchange information specifically related to eye care. Currently, many EHRs are good at handling general medical data, but they may not be as good at handling information from specialized fields like eye care. This guide provides a standard way to represent common eye exam data, such as visual acuity (how clearly you can see), refraction (how your eye bends light), diagnostic tests (like dry eye assessments), and observations of the back of the eye.

This guide is important because it allows different eye care systems to "speak the same language."  For example, if you see an ophthalmologist who uses a different EHR than your optometrist, this guide can help ensure that your eye exam information can be easily shared between them. This can lead to better coordination of care, fewer repeated tests, and a more complete picture of your eye health.

The guide achieves this by defining specific templates for different types of eye exams. These templates specify what information should be captured, how it should be organized, and what codes should be used to represent different findings. These codes ensure that the meaning of the information is clear and consistent across different systems.

While this guide focuses on technical aspects of data exchange, the ultimate goal is to improve the quality and efficiency of eye care for patients. By making it easier to share eye exam information, this guide can help ensure that your eye care providers have the information they need to make the best decisions about your care.
