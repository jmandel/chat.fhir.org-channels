The CDA-EyeCare IG aims to improve how EHRs store and share eye care information. It focuses on creating a standardized way to represent data from common eye exams, such as visual acuity tests, refraction measurements, and assessments of the back of the eye. Currently, many eye care EHRs collect this information, but the lack of a common format makes it difficult to exchange data between different systems. This IG addresses this issue by using the Health Level Seven (HL7) Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) standard, a widely adopted format for exchanging healthcare data. It defines templates based on the CDA Physical Exam section to capture specific eye care data in a structured way. This approach ensures that different eye care systems can easily understand and share information, which can improve efficiency, reduce data loss, and minimize errors when transferring patient records or coordinating care. While the IG leverages existing standards and terminology, it primarily focuses on specialty eye care, which has not always been a priority in broader healthcare data exchange efforts. The CDA-EyeCare IG offers a practical solution for improving interoperability in eye care by providing a structured, standardized approach for representing and exchanging common eye exam data.
