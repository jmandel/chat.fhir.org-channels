This IG aims to standardize how healthcare providers electronically share patient medication information, especially during transitions between care settings like hospitals and nursing homes. It addresses medication errors arising from poor communication. The IG uses FHIR to define a common "language" for sharing medication details, including how medication lists are structured and how systems can securely request and send this information. By promoting consistency, the IG intends to improve the accuracy and completeness of medication information available to different providers, ultimately enhancing patient safety during care transitions. While focused on post-acute care transitions, its principles can be broadly applied to enhance medication information exchange in various healthcare settings. It emphasizes using standardized codes for medications and clear error handling procedures to ensure smooth and reliable communication between different systems.
