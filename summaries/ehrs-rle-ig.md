The "EHR Functional Model - Record Lifecycle Events - FHIR IG" aims to create a standard way for EHRs and other health IT systems to track changes made to patient health information. It addresses the limitations of inconsistent practices in managing health records by introducing a standardized method for documenting actions like creating, updating, viewing, sharing, archiving, and deleting health records. The guide defines specific events called "Record Lifecycle Events" (RLEs) and uses FHIR to specify how these events should be recorded. It leverages FHIR resources like "Provenance" and "AuditEvent" to capture detailed information about each event, including who performed it, what happened, when it occurred, and why. By promoting consistent documentation of these events, the guide aims to improve the reliability, trustworthiness, and interoperability of health data, though it acknowledges that the specific events and associated metadata may need to be extended in the future to accommodate evolving needs in healthcare.
