The SMART App Launch IG focuses on enabling secure connections between independent software applications, or "apps," and EHR systems. It aims to standardize how apps access health data, making it easier for developers to build apps compatible with various EHRs. The IG leverages widely recognized standards like OAuth 2.0 for authorization and FHIR for exchanging healthcare information. This means users can grant apps specific access to their health data without sharing their EHR login details, and apps can understand and utilize data from different systems. SMART App Launch defines procedures for app registration, launching, authorization, and data access. It addresses security concerns by supporting different app types with varying security needs and requiring strong authorization methods. The IG also enables granular control over data access, allowing apps to request only the necessary information. Additionally, it supports sharing contextual information like the current patient or encounter with the app, improving user experience. While the IG considers potential security and privacy risks and offers mitigation strategies, it also acknowledges limitations like scope size restrictions and the experimental nature of some features.
