**TL;DR:** This guide helps computer systems share care plans for people with multiple long-term health conditions.

The HL7Â® Multiple Chronic Condition (MCC) Care Plan Implementation Guide is a set of instructions for healthcare technology experts. It helps them design computer systems that make it easier to create and share care plans for patients with multiple chronic conditions. 

A care plan is a document that outlines a patient's health goals and the steps healthcare providers will take to help them achieve those goals. This guide focuses on care plans for patients in the United States with conditions like chronic kidney disease, diabetes, heart disease, chronic pain, and Long Covid.

The guide explains how to use a special computer language called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) to create care plans. FHIR makes it possible for different computer systems, like those used in hospitals, doctor's offices, and pharmacies, to share information easily. This is important for patients with multiple chronic conditions because they often see many different healthcare providers. 

The guide also includes information about how to collect and share data about social factors that can affect a patient's health, such as access to food and housing. This information can be used to create more comprehensive and effective care plans. 

The guide was developed with input from patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers. It is a valuable resource for healthcare technology experts who are working to improve care for people with multiple chronic conditions.
