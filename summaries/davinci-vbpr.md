The Da Vinci Value-Based Performance Reporting  aims to standardize how healthcare payers share performance data with healthcare providers participating in value-based care contracts, which reward providers for the quality and efficiency of care they deliver. This  defines a common format for these reports, allowing providers to easily understand their performance across different payers. Previously, the lack of a standard format made it difficult for providers to compare reports, track overall performance, and efficiently identify areas for improvement. The  achieves standardization by using  to create specific data structures for performance reports, quality measures, and contract details. It also defines standard terminologies for performance metrics and payment models, ensuring that payers and providers interpret data consistently. While the  promotes flexibility by allowing customization for specific needs, it also mandates that certain key elements must be supported by all implementations to ensure basic interoperability. Currently, the  focuses on reports sent from payers to providers, with future versions potentially addressing provider-to-payer reporting. By establishing a common language for performance reporting, the  seeks to reduce administrative burdens, improve data consistency, and ultimately enhance the effectiveness of value-based care.
