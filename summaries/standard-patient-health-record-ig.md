The Standard Patient Health Record IG aims to make it easier to create personal health record apps that can seamlessly share information with hospitals and other health apps. It does this by defining a standard way to store and exchange health data, ensuring that different systems can understand and use the information. Previously, these apps often used unique data formats that made it difficult to share information between them and hospital systems, leading to information silos and frustration for patients and healthcare providers. This IG leverages the FHIR standard and introduces a standardized file format for personal health records, promoting easier sharing. It focuses on how data is stored and exchanged, rather than dictating specific features for the apps themselves. The guide also addresses the challenge of managing health information over many years, considering different storage methods and data sources. It acknowledges real-world challenges like accessing data in emergencies or for patients with limited technology access and encourages the use of technologies like Bluetooth and QR codes for data transfer. Importantly, it emphasizes patient control over their health information, including the ability to add notes or corrections while maintaining data accuracy and origin. Finally, the guide highlights the importance of data security, patient privacy, and compliance with regulations that give patients the right to access their health data in standardized formats.
