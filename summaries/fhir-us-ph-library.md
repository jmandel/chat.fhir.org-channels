The US Public Health Profiles Library (USPHPL) IG aims to standardize how health information is shared for public health purposes in the United States. It achieves this by defining specific data formats and structures, based on the FHIR standard, making it easier for healthcare providers, EHR systems, and public health agencies to exchange information. Traditionally, public health reporting has often relied on disparate systems and definitions, leading to inefficiencies and difficulties in sharing data. This IG leverages the existing US Core IG as a foundation, adding specific profiles and requirements only when necessary for public health reporting. It addresses various aspects of data exchange, including defining the minimum necessary data elements, ensuring data privacy through masking techniques, and establishing clear expectations for how systems should conform to the guide. The USPHPL also introduces extensions to capture specific information relevant to public health, such as the reason for initiating a report or details about exposures and contact information. Furthermore, it defines profiles for managing value sets and libraries used in public health reporting, including those used for identifying reportable events and supporting automated decision-making. By promoting a standardized approach, the USPHPL aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public health reporting and research.
