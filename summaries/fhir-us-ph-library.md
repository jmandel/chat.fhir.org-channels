**TL;DR:** This guide defines ways to share information needed for public health reporting in the United States.

The US Public Health Profiles Library (USPHPL) defines how electronic health records (EHRs) can share data with public health agencies for reporting purposes. This helps public health agencies collect important information about health trends and outbreaks.

The USPHPL uses a set of rules called "profiles" to standardize the way health information is shared. These profiles make sure that the data sent from EHRs can be understood by public health agencies. The guide also includes a collection of common terms and codes used in public health reporting, which ensures everyone is speaking the same language.

The USPHPL is designed to work with other national healthcare data standards, like the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI). This makes it easier for healthcare providers and public health agencies to share information seamlessly. The guide is constantly evolving to meet the changing needs of public health reporting.
