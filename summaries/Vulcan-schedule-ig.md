The Vulcan Schedule of Activities FHIR IG aims to create a standard way to represent and electronically share schedules for clinical trials. It seeks to improve how different computer systems in healthcare, such as EHRs and research systems, understand and interact with these schedules. The guide focuses specifically on the schedule of activities within a clinical trial and uses a structured approach that defines the necessary data elements and their relationships. It leverages existing healthcare data standards, like FHIR and CDISC ODM, to ensure compatibility with current systems. The guide also addresses the need to represent flexible visit windows and the administration of investigational products. While it acknowledges the importance of representing unscheduled or conditional activities and collaborating with other relevant guidelines, these aspects are not fully addressed in the current version. The goal is to create a basic, functional solution that can be expanded upon in future iterations to handle more complex scenarios. This standardization will ultimately facilitate better planning, execution, and tracking of clinical trials, potentially leading to increased efficiency and improved data quality in clinical research.
