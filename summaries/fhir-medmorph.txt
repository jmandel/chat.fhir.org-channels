**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems automatically share data for public health reporting and research, reducing the workload on doctors and nurses.

The MedMorph Reference Architecture Implementation Guide (IG) defines a standard way for healthcare systems, like electronic health records (EHRs), to automatically send data needed for public health reporting (e.g., tracking diseases) and research studies. It uses a set of rules called "Knowledge Artifacts" to decide what data should be sent and when, based on things that happen during patient care. This automation can reduce the burden on healthcare providers, who currently spend a lot of time manually collecting and sending this data.

The IG aims to make it easier for different healthcare systems to share data with public health agencies and research organizations. It defines how systems should communicate with each other, what data should be included in reports, and how to protect patient privacy when sharing sensitive information.

It's important to note that this guide doesn't change how healthcare providers enter patient data or the types of data they collect. It focuses on how that data is automatically extracted and sent to the appropriate organizations for reporting and research purposes.

This guide also doesn't cover things like accessing insurance claims data or obtaining patient consent for sharing data, as those processes are handled separately by each healthcare organization. It primarily addresses data that can be accessed through a specific type of technology called FHIR APIs.

By using this guide, healthcare systems can participate in public health initiatives and research studies more efficiently, ultimately leading to improvements in healthcare and disease prevention.
