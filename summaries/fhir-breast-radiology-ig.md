**TL;DR:** This guide defines a standard way to share breast imaging reports using FHIR.

The Breast Imaging Implementation Guide (IG) enables healthcare providers to exchange breast imaging reports electronically in a consistent format. It specifies how to represent key information from mammograms, ultrasounds, MRIs, and other imaging studies using the FHIR standard. 

This IG addresses the need for interoperability in breast imaging, allowing different healthcare systems to share reports seamlessly. This helps ensure that patients and their providers have access to complete and accurate imaging information, regardless of where the exams were performed. The guide defines specific data elements for findings, assessments, and recommendations, enabling consistent interpretation and follow-up care. 

By promoting the use of a common standard, this IG facilitates better communication among healthcare providers, improves care coordination, and ultimately enhances patient care in breast imaging.
