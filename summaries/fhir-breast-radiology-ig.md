The Breast Radiology IG defines a standardized way to represent breast imaging reports using FHIR, enabling the exchange of healthcare information electronically. It aims to improve communication of breast imaging findings, assessments, and recommendations between healthcare providers and systems. The IG achieves this by creating specific templates (called profiles) for different types of observations commonly found in breast imaging reports, like those from mammograms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasounds, and others. These templates capture details about abnormalities, including their location, size, and characteristics. Additionally, the guide uses existing medical terminologies like RadLex, SNOMED CT, and LOINC, and introduces new codes where needed, to ensure that the information is understood consistently across different systems. It also provides a structure for the entire report, including sections for findings, impressions, and recommendations for follow-up care. By adhering to this guide, healthcare providers can share breast imaging information in a structured and machine-readable format, which can potentially improve the efficiency and quality of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.
