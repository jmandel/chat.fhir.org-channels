**TL;DR:** This guide helps computer systems share information about potential harmful drug interactions to improve patient safety.

The Potential Drug-Drug Interaction Clinical Decision Support (PDDI CDS) Implementation Guide explains how to use modern health information technology standards to alert healthcare providers about possible harmful drug interactions when prescribing medications. It focuses on making these alerts more accurate and relevant to individual patients by considering their specific medical history and other drugs they are taking.

The guide provides detailed instructions on how to build a system that can check for drug interactions and present clear, actionable advice to doctors at the right time during the prescription process. It also explains how to use standardized codes and formats to represent drug information, making it easier to share and use this knowledge across different healthcare organizations and computer systems.

The guide's goal is to help reduce harmful drug interactions and improve patient safety by making sure doctors have the best possible information when prescribing medications. It recognizes that current drug interaction alerts are often too general and frequently ignored. By providing more specific and timely information, this guide aims to make these alerts more useful and effective.
