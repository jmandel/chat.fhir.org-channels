**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare providers and insurance companies exchange the paperwork needed for insurance coverage.

The Da Vinci Documentation Templates and Rules (DTR) Implementation Guide defines a standard way for healthcare providers and insurance companies to share information electronically. This information is often needed for insurance companies to decide if a medical service, item, or referral will be covered. 

This guide makes it easier for doctors to send the right paperwork to insurance companies. It uses a system called FHIR to create digital forms (called Questionnaires). These forms can be automatically filled in with information from the patient's medical record, saving the doctor time and effort. The guide also allows insurance companies to create forms that change based on the patient's situation, ensuring that only relevant information is collected.

By simplifying the exchange of information, this guide aims to reduce the burden on healthcare providers and speed up the process of getting insurance coverage for patients.
