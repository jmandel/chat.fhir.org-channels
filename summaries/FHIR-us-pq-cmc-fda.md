The FHIR-us-pq-cmc-fda IG seeks to improve how pharmaceutical companies share drug information with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It focuses on standardizing the way drug quality, manufacturing, and control data, known as PQ/CMC data, is submitted. The guide introduces a structured, digital format called FHIR to replace the older, document-based approach. This new method allows the FDA to extract and analyze information more easily, potentially leading to a more efficient review process. The guide provides detailed instructions on how to format PQ/CMC data using FHIR, ensuring consistency across submissions. Currently, the guide focuses on information related to solid oral dosage forms, like tablets and capsules, and is designed to work within the existing electronic submission system used by the FDA. It also incorporates standardized terminology to ensure data is accurately represented. While the guide supports different data formats, it primarily uses the XML format required by the FDA. Future updates to the guide will address additional dosage forms and functionalities. The development of this guide is a joint effort between the FDA and a group focused on healthcare data standards, promoting broader compatibility within the healthcare system.
