**TL;DR:** This guide helps eye doctors and their computer systems share information about patients' eye health more easily. It defines how to use a standard called FHIR to store and exchange details about eye exams, tests, diagnoses, and treatments.

The "Eyes on FHIR" Implementation Guide aims to improve eye care by making it easier to share eye health information between different computer systems. This is important because eye care often involves different specialists, clinics, and devices, and sharing information smoothly can lead to better and faster care.

The guide addresses several needs in the eye care ecosystem:

* **Sharing information between eye doctors and other healthcare providers:** For example, it allows an optometrist and an ophthalmologist to easily share a patient's eye exam results and diagnoses.
* **Enabling research and analysis of eye care data:** By standardizing how eye health information is stored, the guide makes it easier to collect and analyze data for research, helping improve treatments and outcomes. 
* **Supporting the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in eye care:** The guide makes it easier to use AI tools for things like diagnosing eye diseases from images, as these tools need standardized data to work effectively.

The guide achieves this by defining specific ways to use FHIR, a standard for exchanging healthcare information. It includes details on how to represent eye exams, diagnoses (like glaucoma or cataracts), procedures (like cataract surgery), and the results of tests like visual field tests and OCT scans. It also includes specific terms and codes used in eye care, making sure everyone is speaking the same language.

While the guide focuses on technical aspects of data exchange, its ultimate goal is to improve the quality and efficiency of eye care for patients. By making it easier to share information, the guide can help ensure that patients receive the best possible care, no matter where they go for treatment.
