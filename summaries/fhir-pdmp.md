The US Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) FHIR IG defines a standardized way for healthcare providers to electronically request and receive a patient's controlled substance prescription history from state-run PDMPs. These databases track prescriptions to help prevent misuse and improve patient safety. Previously, accessing this information involved various methods with limited compatibility. This IG introduces a modern approach using FHIR, enabling providers to request and receive PDMP data in a structured and consistent format. It offers flexibility by supporting both detailed data and links to formatted reports, accommodating different implementation needs and state regulations. The IG also incorporates mechanisms for integrating this information into existing EHR systems and clinical workflows. While focused specifically on the exchange of PDMP requests and responses between providers and state databases, it aims to improve the efficiency and reliability of accessing crucial patient information, potentially enhancing patient care and addressing prescription drug misuse. The guide primarily targets the US healthcare system, considering its specific pharmacy practices and regulations, including strict security and privacy considerations.
