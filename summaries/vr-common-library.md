The Vital Records Common Profiles Library IG aims to standardize the structure and exchange of digital birth, death, and fetal death records between computer systems. Previously, inconsistent formatting across systems hindered information sharing. This IG introduces standardized formats for data elements like dates and locations, and code lists for attributes like race and cause of death, enabling interoperability. It addresses past inconsistencies by aligning with broader data standards, offering data quality management, and potentially reducing reliance on external code systems. This approach aims to create more efficient and reliable vital records data exchange, though its impact depends on its adoption by various systems and organizations.
