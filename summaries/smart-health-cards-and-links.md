The "SMART Health Cards and Links" IG aims to establish a secure and trustworthy method for individuals to access and share their health information digitally. It introduces two primary standards: SMART Health Cards and SMART Health Links. Health Cards are like digital wallets for health data, containing verifiable information such as vaccination records or test results. They can be stored digitally or printed as a QR code. Health Links, on the other hand, are secure web links that can grant access to more extensive health information, including potentially a patient's entire medical record, through a standardized format. Both standards utilize the FHIR framework to structure data and employ strong encryption and digital signatures to ensure the information's authenticity and privacy. Individuals can choose what information to share and with whom, granting control over their health data. The guide also addresses practical considerations like QR code size limitations and the integration of these standards with existing health systems. The standards are designed to be adaptable and can be implemented independently of specific regulatory frameworks, offering flexibility for diverse applications and jurisdictions.
