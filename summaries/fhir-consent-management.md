This Consent Management IG aims to standardize how healthcare systems handle patient consent for accessing their EHRs. It addresses limitations in existing standards by detailing how to manage the entire consent process, including how patients are informed about and decide on data access. The IG introduces standardized scenarios for common consent actions like requesting, reviewing, and revoking consent, along with specialized data structures and APIs for exchanging consent information. It focuses on consent for data access, not treatment or other healthcare decisions. The IG emphasizes user-friendliness for patients and the need to track consent decisions for accountability. It does not cover user authentication or broader authorization, assuming these are handled elsewhere. By promoting consistent and interoperable methods for managing patient consent, the IG aims to improve patient control over their health information and facilitate secure data sharing across healthcare organizations.
