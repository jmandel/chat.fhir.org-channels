**TL;DR:** This guide explains how patients can control who can see their health information using a standardized, computer-readable format called FHIR. 

The **FHIR Consent Management Implementation Guide** defines how patients can give or revoke permission for others to access their health data. This includes how patients can review and sign consent forms, delegate consent to someone else, and see a history of who has accessed their information. 

This guide focuses on the technical details of how consent is managed, making it easier for different computer systems in healthcare to share information securely and according to patient wishes. It explains how a patient's consent choices are recorded and how these choices are communicated between different systems, like those used by hospitals, doctors' offices, and insurance companies.

**Important Note:** This guide only covers how consent is recorded and shared, not the rules about who can access data or how that data can be used. Those decisions are based on laws, company policies, and the specific permissions granted by the patient through the consent process.
