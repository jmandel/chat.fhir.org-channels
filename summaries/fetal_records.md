This IG provides a standardized way to represent and exchange information about a fetus during pregnancy using FHIR. Previously, healthcare systems lacked a consistent method for handling fetal data, leading to difficulties in sharing information between hospitals, clinics, and labs. This IG addresses the issue by introducing a way to represent a fetus as a distinct entity within EHRs, enabling better tracking of fetal data throughout pregnancy and across different healthcare settings. The guide recommends using a specific extension to the FHIR standard called "Patient with fetal status extension" to identify and link fetal information, such as observations, procedures, and diagnoses. While the IG focuses on data exchange, it acknowledges the need for data linkage and suggests that fetal data can be connected to the mother's record. However, it does not address legal or ethical considerations related to fetal data or prescribe specific data storage methods. Implementing this IG may require updates to existing healthcare systems to ensure they can understand and process the new fetal data representation. The guide aims to improve communication of fetal information but does not replace national guidelines for birth and fetal death reporting.
