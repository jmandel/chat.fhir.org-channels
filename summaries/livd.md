The Laboratory In-Vitro Diagnostics (LIVD) IG aims to simplify how laboratories connect data from diagnostic devices with widely used health data standards. Currently, when labs acquire a new blood analyzer or other diagnostic device, they must manually match the device's specific test codes with standard codes like LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes). This manual process is time-consuming and can lead to errors. The LIVD guide introduces a standardized way for device manufacturers to provide suggested matches between their device's codes and LOINC codes. This is done using a digital format based on the  standard, which allows for easy data exchange. Manufacturers can provide these mappings along with details like the type of specimen and result description. While the guide focuses on matching test results and not test orders, it offers a more efficient and accurate way for laboratories to integrate new devices. It's important to note that these mappings are suggestions, and labs retain the final decision on which codes to use. The guide doesn't automate the configuration of lab systems but instead provides valuable information to assist lab personnel in the mapping process, ultimately improving data sharing and analysis in healthcare.
