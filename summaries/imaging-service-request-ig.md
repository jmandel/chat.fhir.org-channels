This Imaging Service Request IG aims to improve how different computer systems in healthcare facilities share information about medical imaging orders. It focuses on systems that manage orders, like those used by radiology departments, and systems that manage image acquisition, like those used to store and view images. The guide achieves this by creating a common language for these systems based on FHIR. It defines how imaging orders and related details should be represented in FHIR, making sure this aligns with an existing standard called DICOM, which is widely used for medical images. The guide also specifies how systems can create, cancel, and manage imaging orders using FHIR. It acknowledges that DICOM remains the primary source of truth for imaging information and focuses specifically on representing imaging orders for modality worklists, which are lists of imaging exams to be performed. By creating this standardized way to exchange information, the guide aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of imaging workflows in healthcare settings, though it does not address all aspects of the imaging process, such as mapping DICOM MPPS or modeling the entire image ordering workflow.
