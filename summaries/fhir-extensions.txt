**TL;DR:** This guide defines ways to share more detailed health information between different computer systems.

The FHIR Extensions Implementation Guide (IG) expands upon the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to allow for the exchange of richer and more specific health data.  It does this by defining new ways to represent information like custom validation rules and detailed medical terminology.

This IG addresses the need for more complete and nuanced health information sharing in the healthcare ecosystem. For example, it enables healthcare providers to exchange detailed information about patient questionnaires, including specific validation rules to ensure data quality. It also provides a registry of standard codes and value sets that can be used to represent medical concepts in a consistent way across different systems.

By using this guide, developers can build software that can share more detailed health information, leading to better patient care. For example, it could help ensure that patient questionnaires are filled out correctly and that medical information is interpreted consistently across different healthcare providers.

**Limitations:** This guide does not cover all aspects of health information exchange. It focuses specifically on extensions to the FHIR standard. Also, the use of these extensions requires agreement between the systems exchanging information.
