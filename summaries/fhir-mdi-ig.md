The Medicolegal Death Investigation (MDI) IG aims to standardize how information about death investigations is shared in the United States. It uses FHIR to ensure that medical examiners, coroners, laboratories, and vital records offices can easily share information. Previously, these organizations relied on outdated methods like paper and fax, making it difficult to share data efficiently. The MDI IG defines specific ways to structure information related to death investigations, such as sharing findings between medical examiner/coroner offices and vital records offices, transmitting forensic toxicology results from laboratories, and exchanging reports. It is designed to be flexible and work with a variety of existing computer systems in the United States. The guide also recognizes the importance of the Vital Records Death Reporting (VRDR) IG, which focuses on reporting deaths nationally, and aims to support the data sharing processes that occur before information is sent to the national level. While the MDI IG focuses on key aspects of death investigations, it acknowledges the need for future development to support additional data sharing needs and expand the vocabulary used, particularly for forensic toxicology results.
