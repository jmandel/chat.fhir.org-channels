The Physical Activity IG aims to standardize how healthcare systems exchange information about patients' physical activity. It defines a structured approach for recording and sharing data on exercise types, frequency, and patient experiences. This includes creating and managing referrals to fitness services like personal trainers or gyms, as well as supporting patient engagement by enabling access to their data and progress tracking. The IG achieves this by introducing new profiles for existing FHIR resources like CarePlan and Goal, specifically tailored for physical activity data. It also introduces temporary codes for concepts not yet in standard terminologies and emphasizes the use of RESTful interactions for seamless data exchange between systems. The IG acknowledges different capabilities among service providers and promotes a patient-centered approach by ensuring data access and encouraging patient involvement in setting and achieving fitness goals. The guide's focus on structured data and interoperability aims to improve the coordination of care and support broader healthcare interoperability efforts, particularly future alignment with the US Core standard.
