**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems share information about physical activity.

The Physical Activity Implementation Guide (IG) defines a standard way to exchange information about a patient's physical activity levels and related interventions. It uses FHIR, a common language for healthcare data, to ensure that different systems can understand and share this information.

The IG addresses the need for better communication about physical activity between patients, healthcare providers, and fitness service providers. It enables patients to track and share their activity data with their doctors, allows providers to refer patients to appropriate fitness programs, and helps fitness providers report back on patient progress.

The IG includes specific profiles for common physical activity data, such as the Exercise Vital Sign, which captures a patient's self-reported activity levels. It also defines how to exchange information about care plans, goals, referrals, and reports related to physical activity.

By standardizing how physical activity data is represented and exchanged, this IG aims to improve patient care and support efforts to promote healthy lifestyles. It provides a framework for seamless communication between different healthcare systems, enabling more coordinated and effective care for patients working to improve their physical activity levels.
