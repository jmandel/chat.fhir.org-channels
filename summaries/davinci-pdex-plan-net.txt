## PDEX Payer Network Implementation Guide: Summary for Patients and Non-Experts

**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare apps easily access information about insurance plans and their provider networks. 

The PDEX Payer Network Implementation Guide (also called Plan-Net) sets a standard for how health insurers should share information about their insurance plans, the healthcare providers in their networks, and the locations where these providers offer services. This makes it possible for third parties to build apps that let patients and providers easily find in-network doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, and other healthcare professionals who can meet their needs. 

This guide focuses specifically on provider directories maintained by payers (insurance companies). It allows apps to search for providers based on various criteria, such as name, specialty, location, and whether they are accepting new patients. This information can then be displayed in a user-friendly way, making it easier for patients to find the right healthcare provider for their situation.

While this guide defines how to access the provider directory information, it doesn't specify how patients would find the right app or website to use.  It also doesnâ€™t require apps to provide any personal information about the patient when they search for providers, helping to protect patient privacy.
