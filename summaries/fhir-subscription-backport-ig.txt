**TL;DR:** This guide helps computer systems using older versions of FHIR to use the latest features for real-time updates.

The "Subscription R5 Backport Implementation Guide" lets computer systems that use older versions of the FHIR standard get real-time updates when health information changes. FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically.

This guide is important because it allows healthcare providers to be notified immediately when important patient information is updated. For example, a doctor could be notified as soon as a patient's lab results are available. This can help improve patient care by allowing providers to make more informed decisions.

The guide defines a way for systems to subscribe to specific types of updates, such as new lab results or changes to a patient's medication list. It also defines how these updates are sent to the subscribing system. 

The guide also addresses security concerns by allowing systems to limit the amount of information that is sent in each update. For example, a system could choose to only send the patient's ID and the type of update, rather than sending the full patient record. This helps to protect patient privacy.

This guide is a technical document intended for software developers who build systems that use FHIR. However, it is important for patients and other non-experts to understand how this guide can help improve the way healthcare information is shared and used.
