The CardX Hypertension Management IG aims to improve the way patients and healthcare providers share and manage blood pressure information. It addresses the limitations of traditional blood pressure monitoring, which often relies on infrequent measurements taken during clinic visits. This IG introduces a standardized method for electronically exchanging home blood pressure readings, also known as self-measured blood pressure (SMBP), between patients' devices, health tracking applications, and EHR systems. By using FHIR, the IG enables the secure and reliable transfer of SMBP data. This allows healthcare providers to access a more comprehensive view of a patient's blood pressure patterns, potentially leading to more timely and informed treatment decisions. While the IG promotes a more proactive approach to hypertension management, it's important to note that its effectiveness depends on factors such as patient adherence to home monitoring and the integration of FHIR-compatible systems within healthcare settings. The IG's future iterations plan to incorporate additional elements relevant to hypertension management, including lifestyle modifications and medication adherence.
