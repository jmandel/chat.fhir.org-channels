**TL;DR:** This guide establishes a single source of truth for commonly used terminology in healthcare, including codes and their meanings for diseases, procedures, medications, and more. It aims to improve consistency and reduce errors when sharing health information between different computer systems.

The Unified Terminology Governance (UTG) Implementation Guide (IG) aims to create a central repository of standardized healthcare terminology that can be used across various systems and organizations. It brings together terminology from different sources, including HL7 v2, v3, and FHIR, ensuring they are consistently defined and easily accessible. 

This IG addresses the need for a unified source of truth for healthcare terminology by:

*   **Standardizing definitions:** The UTG establishes clear, consistent definitions for common healthcare terms and codes, reducing ambiguity and potential errors when exchanging information.
*   **Improving interoperability:** By providing a shared set of terminology, the UTG enables different computer systems to communicate more effectively, facilitating seamless data exchange between hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and other healthcare providers.
*   **Simplifying terminology management:** The UTG offers a central location for managing and updating healthcare terminology, making it easier for organizations to stay current with the latest standards and ensure data accuracy.

The UTG IG is essential for developers building healthcare applications and organizations seeking to improve the interoperability of their systems. It provides a reliable foundation for sharing health information accurately and efficiently, ultimately contributing to better patient care.
