The BSeR IG aims to improve how healthcare providers refer patients to other providers or community organizations for specific health needs, such as diabetes prevention or tobacco cessation. Currently, referrals often involve sharing a patient's entire medical history, which can be inefficient and raise privacy concerns. This IG leverages FHIR to create a structured approach for referrals, ensuring that only the minimum necessary information is shared. It defines what data is needed for different referral types and uses FHIR resources to manage the referral process, track its status, and link requests with feedback. The guide supports various methods for exchanging information and is designed to align with existing health information technology standards and HIPAA regulations on patient privacy. While the IG aims to improve provider engagement and care coordination by enabling the sharing of patient outcomes, its actual impact may vary depending on implementation and adoption across healthcare systems. The guide is designed to be adaptable for future referral types, but its long-term effectiveness will depend on ongoing updates and industry support.
