**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems understand and use medical imaging results stored in a specific format called DICOM SR.

The DICOM SR to FHIR Implementation Guide defines how to convert medical imaging observations from the DICOM SR format to FHIR resources. DICOM SR, which stands for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine - Structured Report, is a standard way to store observations made during medical imaging procedures. These observations can include measurements taken by a sonographer, notes by a radiologist, or results from automated analysis. 

This guide focuses specifically on a type of DICOM SR called a "Measurement Report." It provides a way to translate the information from this report into FHIR resources, particularly the "Observation" resource. This makes it easier for systems that use FHIR to understand and use the results from medical imaging. 

The guide assumes that information about the patient, the imaging study, and the request for the study already exist in the FHIR system. It primarily focuses on converting the imaging measurements and related details, not on recreating the entire medical history. 

While this guide allows for the conversion of imaging results into FHIR, it may not be possible to convert back to a complete DICOM SR from the FHIR resources. This is because the guide focuses on translating the most important information for general use and may not include every detail from the original DICOM SR.
