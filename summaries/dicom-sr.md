This IG addresses the challenge of sharing medical imaging information between systems that use different data standards. Specifically, it focuses on translating imaging measurements stored in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Structured Report format into the FHIR format, which is commonly used by EHRs and other healthcare systems. The guide achieves this by providing a detailed mapping between elements within a specific type of DICOM report (called a Measurement Report) and corresponding elements in FHIR resources, primarily the FHIR "Observation" resource. This mapping enables the conversion of DICOM data into a format that FHIR-based systems can understand. However, the guide has some limitations. It only addresses the conversion from DICOM to FHIR, not the reverse. It also focuses on a specific type of DICOM report and does not cover all possible imaging observations. Additionally, it assumes that relevant patient and imaging information already exists in the FHIR system. While the guide primarily uses the "Observation" resource, it acknowledges that some context might be lost during the translation. Despite these limitations, the guide represents a significant step towards improving the interoperability of imaging data and enabling broader sharing of these results within the healthcare ecosystem.
