**TL;DR:** This guide helps researchers use a standard way to share information when doing studies that involve more than one hospital or clinic.

The Single IRB (sIRB) FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) defines a standard way to create and exchange information needed for multi-site research studies. This means if a study is happening at multiple hospitals or clinics, they can all use the same forms and share information easily. 

This IG addresses a common problem in research: the need for each location in a study to get approval from their own ethics review board (called an IRB). This can be slow and create extra work. The sIRB IG supports the use of a single IRB for all study locations. This makes it faster to get studies started and reduces the workload for everyone involved.

The guide focuses on using a specific technology called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) to create and share these forms. FHIR helps different computer systems talk to each other.  Instead of emailing PDFs or using different software at each location, researchers can use the same FHIR forms and send them electronically. This saves time and reduces errors.

The sIRB IG includes instructions and examples for different types of forms used in research, such as study protocols, consent forms, and reports of any problems that happen during the study. It also explains how to use FHIR to automatically fill in parts of the forms with information that's already been collected.

It's important to note that this guide is still being developed and tested. In the future, it may be expanded to include more types of forms and to work better with other research systems. The goal is to make it easier to do research that involves multiple locations and to improve the quality and safety of research studies.
