**TL;DR:** This guide defines a language for computers to understand and use healthcare information to support better care.

The Clinical Quality Language (CQL) Implementation Guide defines a language for sharing healthcare logic between different computer systems. This logic can be used to define criteria for quality measures, make decisions about patient care, and improve healthcare processes. 

CQL addresses the need for a common language that computers can use to understand and process healthcare information. It provides a way to express complex clinical knowledge in a way that is both human-readable and machine-processable.

This guide is important because it enables different healthcare systems to share and use the same logic. This can help to improve patient care by ensuring that the same criteria are used to make decisions, regardless of which system is being used. It can also help to improve healthcare quality by making it easier to measure and track performance.

CQL supports a variety of data models, including the Quality Data Model (QDM) and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. It also supports a variety of terminologies, including SNOMED CT and LOINC.

This guide is intended for a wide audience, including healthcare providers, health IT professionals, and quality measure developers. It provides a comprehensive overview of CQL, including its syntax, semantics, and implementation details.
