The Electronic Health Record System Functional Model Release 2.1 IG aims to improve how EHRs work together. It does this by creating a standardized list of functions that all EHRs should be able to perform, such as managing patient records, scheduling appointments, and handling billing. This list is organized in a way that allows healthcare providers to easily understand and use it. Additionally, the guide allows for customization based on the specific needs of different healthcare settings, like hospitals or clinics. To ensure that EHR systems actually meet these standards, the guide includes specific criteria for each function. The EHR-S FM R2.1 IG utilizes the FHIR standard, which helps with validating and managing different versions of the guide. While the IG promotes better communication and information sharing between different EHR systems, it's important to note that it focuses on what EHRs should be able to do, not on the specific technology used to achieve it. The guide also acknowledges that it may need to be updated in the future to keep up with changes in technology and healthcare practices.
