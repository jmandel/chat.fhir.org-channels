The Post-Acute Orders (PAO) IG defines a standardized method for healthcare providers to electronically exchange orders for services and equipment needed by patients transitioning from an acute care setting (like a hospital) to post-acute care. It addresses the current lack of standardization in exchanging orders for things like Durable Medical Equipment (e.g., wheelchairs, oxygen tanks), associated medications, and home health services, which often relies on inefficient and error-prone manual processes. The PAO IG leverages the FHIR standard to structure the exchange of this information. It outlines specific data structures and extensions for common FHIR resources like DeviceRequest, ServiceRequest, and MedicationRequest to meet the specific requirements of post-acute care ordering. The guide supports both real-time exchange through RESTful Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and message-based exchange using FHIR Messaging, catering to different technical capabilities. It also defines the roles of different participants, including ordering providers, rendering providers, and intermediaries, and how they interact using these methods. While the current version primarily focuses on Durable Medical Equipment and home health, it aims to expand to other post-acute services in the future. It also acknowledges the importance of processes like prior authorization and clarifies its relationship with other relevant standards like Bidirectional Services eReferrals (BSeR). The PAO IG represents a significant step towards streamlining the post-acute care ordering process, potentially leading to faster delivery of necessary services and equipment for patients.
