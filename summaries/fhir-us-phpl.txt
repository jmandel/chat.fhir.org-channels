**TL;DR:** This guide defines ways to better share patient information for public health purposes in the United States.

The US Public Health Profiles Library (USPHPL) helps to easily share patient information between healthcare providers and public health agencies in the United States. It builds on the US Core Implementation Guide, a set of standards for exchanging healthcare data.

The USPHPL is important because it allows public health agencies to collect the information they need to track and respond to health threats, such as outbreaks of infectious diseases. The guide defines specific data elements that should be included in public health reports, such as patient demographics, medical history, and laboratory results. It also provides guidance on how to protect patient privacy when sharing this information.

The USPHPL is a valuable resource for healthcare organizations, electronic health record companies, and public health agencies that are working to improve public health surveillance and reporting. By making it easier to share patient information, the USPHPL can help to improve the health of the nation.
