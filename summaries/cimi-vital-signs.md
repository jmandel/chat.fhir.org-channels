The Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI) Vital Signs IG aims to improve how healthcare systems record and exchange common vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature. Currently, different systems may use varying methods, making it difficult to share and compare this data. This IG addresses the issue by using FHIR to create a consistent way to represent vital signs. It defines specific FHIR profiles for each vital sign, including standard Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) for clear identification, mandatory data elements like the patient and time of measurement, and extensions for additional information like body position and device used. While currently focused on the US healthcare system, the IG emphasizes the importance of using standardized terminology and provides guidance on tracking data origin. It also includes profiles for blood pressure panels and average blood pressure measurements, recognizing common clinical practices and the increasing use of home monitoring devices. The IG aims to improve interoperability, particularly with wearable devices and EHRs, but it is limited in scope to the US and relies on the implementation of "must support" elements by all systems for optimal effectiveness.
