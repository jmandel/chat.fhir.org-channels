The Human Services Directory IG aims to improve the sharing of information about social services, such as food banks or housing assistance, between different computer systems. It addresses previous challenges where information was scattered, inconsistent, and difficult to exchange due to a lack of standardization. The IG achieves this by using FHIR to create a common way to represent and exchange data about organizations, locations, and services. It maps its data elements to the Human Services Data Specification, ensuring compatibility with existing systems. The IG enables systems to search for services based on criteria like location or service type using a standardized API. Currently, it focuses on allowing systems to read information from a single directory at a time, without the ability to update it. It also allows flexibility in the choice of service classification systems and prioritizes privacy by prohibiting the transmission of personally identifiable information during searches. By promoting a standardized approach, the Human Services Directory IG aims to facilitate easier access to social services and improve coordination between healthcare providers, insurance companies, and individuals seeking support.
