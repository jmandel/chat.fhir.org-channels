This IG addresses the challenge of exchanging patient information between healthcare systems that use different data standards: the older Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) and the newer FHIR. It provides a method for translating clinical documents from C-CDA to FHIR and vice versa. This is achieved by creating specialized FHIR structures that mirror C-CDA document types and by defining detailed rules for converting specific data elements between the two standards. The IG leverages existing standards like the US Core FHIR profiles and focuses initially on common clinical areas like problems, allergies, medications, and immunizations. While the guide aims to automate the translation process, it acknowledges that perfect conversion may not always be possible due to inherent differences between C-CDA and FHIR. The IG represents a collaborative effort and will be updated as needed to accommodate the evolution of both standards. It offers a practical approach to improve the sharing of patient data, but it's crucial to understand that the translation process may not be entirely lossless in all cases.
