**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems share patient information between two different data formats.

The Consolidated CDA (C-CDA) on FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) defines how to represent C-CDA documents using FHIR resources. C-CDA is a widely used standard for exchanging healthcare information, like patient summaries and clinical notes. FHIR is a newer standard that is easier to implement and use. This guide helps bridge the gap between these two standards, enabling healthcare systems to share patient information more easily.

This IG focuses on the most commonly exchanged patient information, including problems, allergies, medications, immunizations, procedures, and basic patient demographics. It provides detailed instructions on how to map data elements between C-CDA and FHIR, ensuring that information is translated accurately and consistently. 

While this guide enables more seamless data exchange, it's important to note that the two standards are not always perfectly aligned. Some information may be lost or require interpretation during the translation process. This highlights the need for ongoing efforts to harmonize healthcare data standards and improve interoperability.
