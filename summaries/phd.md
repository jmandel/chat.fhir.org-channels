The Personal Health Device Data IG seeks to standardize how data from personal health devices, such as blood pressure monitors and glucose meters, is electronically shared between systems and applications. It accomplishes this by providing a standardized way to represent device data and information about the device itself using FHIR. This IG focuses on devices that can send data electronically and offers detailed instructions on how to map data from various device types to the FHIR format. Notably, the IG employs a flexible approach that can accommodate a wide array of devices without requiring specific knowledge of each device type, ensuring compatibility with future devices and measurements. It also addresses the challenge of ensuring accurate time stamps from devices with varying levels of time synchronization. However, it's important to note that this IG focuses solely on devices capable of electronic data transmission, excluding manual data entry or non-communicating devices. Furthermore, it does not interpret the data or offer guidance on its use; it simply defines the structure for sharing, leaving the interpretation and utilization to the receiving system.
