**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare providers send and receive electronic referrals for patients needing extra support.

The Bidirectional Services eReferral (BSeR) Implementation Guide explains how to use a standardized format for electronic referrals. It covers referrals for conditions like diabetes, obesity, arthritis, hypertension, early childhood nutrition, and tobacco use.

The guide focuses on sharing only the necessary information between healthcare providers to protect patient privacy. It also allows for feedback from the referral recipient to the original provider, creating a closed loop for better communication and patient care.

Instead of sending a patient's entire medical history, the guide helps providers select specific information relevant to the referral. This ensures that only the minimum necessary information is shared, keeping patient data secure.

The guide also defines a workflow for referrals. It explains how a referral is created, accepted, tracked, and completed. This helps healthcare providers across different organizations work together smoothly to coordinate patient care.

By standardizing the referral process, this guide aims to improve communication and coordination between healthcare providers and community organizations. This can help patients access the services they need more efficiently and effectively.
