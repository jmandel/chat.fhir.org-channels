The Adverse Event Clinical Care IG aims to improve how healthcare professionals document and exchange information about adverse events during patient care. It creates a standardized method for recording event details, including the affected individual, cause, and response. The IG utilizes FHIR to define the "AdverseEvent Clinical Care" profile, guiding how to organize data elements like patient demographics, event description, suspected cause, and actions taken. Tailored for clinical settings like hospitals and clinics, the IG recognizes that adverse event reporting may involve a two-step process, such as initial reporting by a nurse and subsequent review by a physician. It acknowledges that complete information might not be available immediately and allows for updates. By using FHIR, the IG promotes interoperability, enabling the exchange of adverse event data between different EHR systems and healthcare organizations. However, the IG does not explicitly address how adverse event reporting was handled previously or the limitations of those approaches.
