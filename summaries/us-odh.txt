**TL;DR:** This guide helps electronic health records (EHRs) store and share information about a patient's work history. This information, called Occupational Data for Health (ODH), can help doctors provide better care by understanding how work impacts a patient's health.

The Occupational Data for Health (ODH) Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize how information about a patient's job is stored and shared between different healthcare systems. It focuses on structuring work-related details within EHRs, allowing doctors and other healthcare providers to easily access and use this information when treating patients.

ODH is important because a person's job can significantly affect their health. For example, someone's work environment might contribute to a chronic illness, or past exposure to workplace hazards could explain current symptoms. By having this information readily available, healthcare professionals can make more informed decisions about a patient's care.

This guide provides a standard way to record various aspects of a patient's work history, including:

* **Employment Status:** Whether someone is currently employed, unemployed, retired, etc.
* **Work History:** Details about past and present jobs, including the type of work, industry, work schedule, and potential hazards.
* **Usual Work:** Information about the type of work a person typically does, even if they've had many different jobs.

This guide also considers the work history of a patient's household members, as this can also impact their health. For example, if a family member works with hazardous materials, it could affect the health of everyone in the household.

While this guide is primarily focused on supporting healthcare needs in the United States, it is designed to be adaptable for use in other countries as well.

It is important to note that this guide does not cover all possible aspects of work and health. It is also not intended to support billing or administrative tasks. However, it provides a solid foundation for capturing essential work-related information that can improve the quality and effectiveness of patient care.
