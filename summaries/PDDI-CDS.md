This IG focuses on improving how EHRs warn doctors about potential harmful drug-drug interactions. Traditionally, these warnings were often too general and didn't consider the patient's specific details, leading doctors to frequently ignore them. This IG proposes a new approach using modern technology standards to make these warnings more helpful. It suggests using patient information to create personalized warnings, providing them earlier in the medication ordering process, and offering specific recommendations to doctors, such as changing a medication or adding a protective one. The guide focuses specifically on interactions between drugs, not including interactions with things like vitamins or food. It outlines how the alerts can be integrated into the doctor's workflow within the EHR and suggests ways to customize the system for different clinical settings. Importantly, it emphasizes the need for doctors to be involved in setting up the system to ensure the warnings are useful and don't lead to unnecessary alert fatigue, which happens when doctors are overwhelmed by too many warnings. The guide also addresses how to handle situations where the system might need access to sensitive patient information.
