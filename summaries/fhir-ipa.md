The International Patient Access (IPA) IG defines a standardized way for patients to access their health information electronically, regardless of where the data is stored. It aims to solve the problem of fragmented health data by enabling applications, such as personal health record apps, to retrieve patient information like medical history, medications, and lab results from different healthcare systems. IPA leverages the FHIR standard to define a common set of data elements and a secure way for apps to access them. It utilizes the FHIR RESTful API and the SMART App Launch framework, which is based on the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework, to ensure secure access to patient records. IPA focuses on a core set of essential patient data, primarily supporting read-only access, with the expectation that countries and regions may build upon this foundation with their specific requirements. It complements the International Patient Summary standard, which provides a concise overview of patient data, by enabling access to the full patient record. IPA is designed to be an evolving standard, incorporating feedback from implementers and users to enhance interoperability and address challenges in accessing health information globally.
