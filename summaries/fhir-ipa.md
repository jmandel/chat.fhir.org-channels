**TL;DR:** This guide helps patients get their health information from doctors and hospitals in a safe and secure way.

The International Patient Access (IPA) Implementation Guide explains how apps can get a patient's health information from their doctors or hospitals. It uses a standard way of sharing information called FHIR, which makes it easier for different computer systems to talk to each other. 

This guide is designed to help patients see their own medical records. It also explains how to make sure that only authorized people, like the patient or their doctor, can see the information. The guide uses a system called SMART on FHIR, which is like a secure login for health apps. 

With IPA, patients can use apps to see things like their diagnoses, medications, allergies, lab results, and doctors' notes. This can help patients be more involved in their own healthcare. It's important to remember that this guide only explains how to get the information, not how to understand it. Patients should always talk to their doctor if they have questions about their health. 

Different countries might have their own rules about accessing health information, so this guide provides a basic set of rules that can be used anywhere. It's like a starting point that each country can build on. This way, patient apps can work in many different places. 

The guide also talks about some important things to keep in mind when building these apps, like how to make sure the right patient is getting the right information and how to protect patient privacy.
