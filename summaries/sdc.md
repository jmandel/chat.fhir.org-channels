This IG focuses on standardizing how healthcare forms are created, completed, and processed electronically. It leverages FHIR to define the structure and content of digital forms. This means that different healthcare systems can use and understand these forms, improving how information is shared. The guide details how to design forms with questions and response options, and how to pre-fill them with existing patient data, saving time and reducing errors. It also outlines methods for extracting information from completed forms and converting it into structured data that can be used for various purposes, such as patient care, research, or administrative tasks. This structured data can then be easily shared and understood by different computer systems. The guide promotes consistency and interoperability in handling healthcare forms, potentially leading to more efficient and accurate data exchange in healthcare settings.
