**TL;DR:** This guide helps create digital questionnaires that collect health information in a standardized way.

The Structured Data Capture (SDC) Implementation Guide defines how to use the HL7 FHIR standard to create digital questionnaires for collecting health information. 

The guide helps ensure questionnaires are designed to gather information consistently, making it easier to share and analyze. It provides ways to pre-populate forms with existing patient data, reducing the need for patients and healthcare providers to enter the same information multiple times.  The guide also provides mechanisms for extracting data from completed questionnaires, allowing the information to be used in other systems, such as electronic health records.

The SDC Implementation Guide supports complex questionnaire designs, including those that adapt based on prior answers. This allows for more efficient and targeted data collection. The guide also includes examples and test cases to help developers create and implement SDC-compliant questionnaires.

While the guide provides a standardized approach, it does not dictate specific content or clinical workflows.  The actual use of questionnaires will vary depending on the needs of the healthcare organization or research project.
