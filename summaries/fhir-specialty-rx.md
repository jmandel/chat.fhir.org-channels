This IG defines a standardized approach for exchanging patient information needed to fill prescriptions for specialty medications, which are usually high-cost drugs with complex handling requirements. It aims to improve the efficiency of this process, which traditionally involved manual and time-consuming steps, leading to delays in patients receiving their medications. The guide leverages FHIR to specify how patient demographics, clinical details (such as allergies and medical conditions), insurance data, and patient consents should be shared between healthcare providers (like doctors) and those fulfilling prescriptions (like pharmacies and specialty hubs). It outlines two main methods: one where the pharmacy requests information from the prescriber's EHR system and another where the prescriber's system proactively sends the information. The guide focuses specifically on the United States healthcare system and specialty medications, excluding the transmission of the initial prescription itself, which is handled by a separate standard. It accommodates different technological capabilities by supporting both direct data exchange and the use of intermediaries, and it includes a defined process for handling patient consent, a crucial aspect of specialty medication fulfillment. While it aims to streamline the process, the IG primarily focuses on standardizing data exchange and does not address all potential challenges in specialty medication fulfillment.
