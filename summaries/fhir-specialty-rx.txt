**TL;DR:** This guide helps pharmacies get the information they need to fill prescriptions for specialty medications.

The Specialty Medication Enrollment Implementation Guide defines how to exchange patient information to help pharmacies fill prescriptions for specialty medications. Specialty medications are usually expensive or need special handling, and pharmacies often need extra information to make sure patients can get their medications quickly.

This guide lets pharmacies get information from a patient's electronic health records (EHR) in two ways: 
* Pharmacies can send a request to the prescriber's EHR system for information like allergies, medical conditions, and insurance coverage. 
* The prescriber's EHR system can automatically send this information to the pharmacy when a specialty medication is prescribed.

Sometimes, pharmacies need to ask the prescriber for more information. This guide allows pharmacies to send a task to the prescriber's EHR system, which can then prompt the prescriber to launch a special app to answer questions or provide more details.

This guide also defines how pharmacies can request and receive consent forms that patients need to sign for certain specialty medications. This can be done through a task sent to the prescriber's EHR system, or the prescriber's EHR system can proactively send the completed consent form to the pharmacy. 

This guide helps to make sure that patients get their specialty medications quickly and easily.
