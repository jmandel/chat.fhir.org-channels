**TL;DR:** This guide helps computer systems share patient health information in a safe and standardized way.

The HL7 Electronic Health Record System Functional Model (EHR-S FM) Implementation Guide defines how computer systems used for electronic health records (EHRs) should work. It describes the features and functions that these systems should have to manage patient information effectively and securely. This includes things like creating and managing patient records, handling orders for medications and tests, supporting patient privacy and security, and sharing information with other healthcare providers. 

The guide is designed to help different computer systems understand and use the same types of health information. This way, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers can access the information they need, when they need it, no matter where the patient goes for care. It helps make sure that patient information is accurate, complete, and protected.

The guide also explains how to create profiles, which are customized sets of functions tailored to specific healthcare settings or needs. For example, a profile might be created for a hospital, a doctor's office, or a research study. 

This guide is important because it helps improve patient care by making it easier for healthcare providers to share information. It also helps to protect patient privacy and security by setting standards for how patient information is handled.
