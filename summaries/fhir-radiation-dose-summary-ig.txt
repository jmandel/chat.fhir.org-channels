**TL;DR:** This guide helps share summaries of radiation doses from medical imaging exams.

The *FHIR Radiation Dose Summary Implementation Guide* defines a standard way to share information about radiation doses received by patients during medical imaging exams. This information can be used by healthcare providers to track radiation exposure, improve patient safety, and ensure compliance with regulations.

The guide focuses on sharing minimal dose information, such as the type of exam, the amount of radiation used, and the date of the exam. It does not include detailed information about radiation administration or cumulative radiation exposure over time. 

The guide does not provide guidance on how to interpret the radiation information or make decisions about patient care. Healthcare providers should use their professional judgment and follow relevant guidelines when interpreting radiation dose summaries.

This guide is intended for use by healthcare providers, software developers, and other stakeholders involved in the exchange of radiation dose information. It is based on the HL7 FHIR standard, which is a widely used standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically.
