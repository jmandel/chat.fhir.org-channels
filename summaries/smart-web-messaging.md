The SMART Web Messaging IG defines a standardized way for web-based health applications to interact more effectively with EHR systems. It aims to overcome limitations of previous approaches by enabling apps to exchange information and trigger actions within the EHR more seamlessly. This is achieved through a secure communication method using the browser's built-in messaging capabilities. The guide specifies how apps can send data to the EHR (like orders or clinical notes), prompt actions in the EHR (like navigating to a specific patient record), and work with temporary data during a clinician's session. It also allows apps to communicate with the EHR's data server indirectly when a direct connection isn't feasible. This standardized approach relies on defined message types and structures, ensuring that apps and EHRs can understand each other. The guide focuses specifically on web applications used within an EHR environment and leverages existing standards like FHIR and OAuth for compatibility and security.
