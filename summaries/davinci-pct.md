The Da Vinci Patient Cost Transparency IG aims to standardize how healthcare providers and insurance companies share cost information with patients, primarily focusing on upfront cost estimates for planned medical services. It achieves this by defining a common format, using FHIR, for sharing Good Faith Estimates (GFEs), which are upfront cost estimates, and Advanced Explanation of Benefits (AEOBs), which are detailed breakdowns of costs after service. The IG promotes using secure APIs for exchanging this information between providers, payers, and patient-authorized applications. While it outlines workflows for providers to submit GFEs and payers to generate AEOBs, it also acknowledges that other delivery methods for AEOBs may be used. The IG's development is influenced by the No Surprises Act, which mandates providing GFEs and AEOBs to patients. It builds upon existing healthcare data standards and incorporates security and privacy best practices. It is important to note that the IG primarily addresses cost estimates for future services and does not cover areas like eligibility checks or claim submissions. Additionally, a workflow for coordinating GFEs when multiple providers are involved is still under development.
