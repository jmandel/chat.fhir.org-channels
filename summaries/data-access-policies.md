This IG defines a standardized approach to controlling access to healthcare data, aiming to improve consistency and interoperability across different systems. It leverages the FHIR standard, specifically the "Permission" resource, to establish granular rules about who can access what data and under what conditions. These rules can be based on factors like a user's role (e.g., doctor or nurse), the intended purpose of data use (e.g., treatment or research), the type of data being accessed, and patient consent preferences. The guide also explores incorporating security labels to categorize data sensitivity and using attribute-based access control for more fine-grained permissions based on specific attributes or the context of a request. It addresses how to combine multiple access rules, manage exceptions like emergency access, and align with overarching organizational policies. However, the reliance on FHIR necessitates familiarity with this standard, and the guide acknowledges that contextual factors like the relationship between the data requester and the patient can influence access decisions, which may require additional considerations beyond the scope of the technical implementation.
