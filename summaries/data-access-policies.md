**TL;DR:** This guide helps control who can see your health information and how they can use it.

The Security Work Group FHIR Data Access Policies Implementation Guide (IG) defines how to set up and use rules for controlling access to health information. This guide explains how to use the FHIR "Permission" resource to create detailed rules about who can see what information and how they can use it.

This IG is important because it helps healthcare organizations protect patient privacy and comply with laws like HIPAA. It also helps make sure that people only see the information they need to do their jobs. For example, a doctor might need to see all of a patient's medical history, but a billing clerk might only need to see information about insurance.

The IG provides examples of how to create different types of rules, such as:

* **Role-based access control:** This type of rule lets you control access based on a person's job role. For example, you could create a rule that says only doctors can see a patient's medical records.
* **Attribute-based access control:** This type of rule lets you control access based on specific characteristics of the information or the person requesting access. For example, you could create a rule that says only researchers can see de-identified patient data for a specific study.
* **Contextual access control:** This type of rule lets you control access based on the situation. For example, you could create a rule that says a doctor can only see a patient's mental health records if the patient has given their consent.

The IG also includes examples of how to use the "Permission" resource to control access to specific types of information, such as patient directories and provider directories.

This guide is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about how to control access to health information using FHIR. It is especially helpful for healthcare organizations that are implementing FHIR-based systems.
