**TL;DR:** This guide helps computer systems share information about cancer patients.

The Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) Implementation Guide defines a standard way to represent and share information about cancer patients. It helps different computer systems, such as those used in hospitals and labs, talk to each other and exchange data in a consistent format.

mCODE makes it easier to collect and analyze information about cancer diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. It includes details about the patient's cancer type, stage, tumor characteristics, and treatments received, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. It also covers the patient's overall health, including performance status and other medical conditions.

mCODE also incorporates genetic information, which is becoming increasingly important in cancer care. It helps standardize the way genetic test results are shared between labs and healthcare providers.

While mCODE focuses on a core set of essential data elements, it can be extended to include more specialized information as needed. By promoting consistent data exchange, mCODE aims to improve cancer care, research, and public health reporting.
