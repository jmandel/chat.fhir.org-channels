The Da Vinci CDex IG aims to standardize how payers and providers share patient clinical data using FHIR. It seeks to replace older methods like fax and portals with three FHIR-based approaches: Direct Query, where payers can directly request data from provider systems; a Task-Based Approach for requests requiring human review; and Attachments, enabling standardized document exchange. The IG acknowledges that some exchanges may still require human intervention and aims to be compatible with existing processes while encouraging a gradual shift towards automated methods like Direct Query. It also emphasizes clear communication about the purpose of data requests to ensure patient privacy and data security, including guidance on electronic signatures. While the IG offers potential benefits like streamlined claims processing and prior authorization, its widespread adoption and impact will depend on factors like industry collaboration and technological advancements.
