The Ophthalmology IG aims to standardize electronic eye care data representation and sharing. It addresses challenges in exchanging information between systems like EHRs and diagnostic devices by defining profiles for common eye care data elements, ensuring consistent recording. It also establishes standardized vocabularies and codes using ValueSets and CodeSystems. The IG leverages existing standards like SNOMED CT, ICD-10, and CPT. Use Cases illustrate its application, such as sharing cataract surgery outcomes or managing glaucoma patients. By enabling seamless data exchange, the IG aims to facilitate benchmarking, research, care coordination, and tracking patient journeys. The guide acknowledges the increasing role of artificial intelligence in eye care and the need for collaborative care models.
