This IG defines a standardized way to exchange electronic information about cancer pathology (laboratory analysis of tissues potentially affected by cancer) between healthcare systems using FHIR. It aims to replace older, less flexible methods with a modern approach that allows computer systems to easily understand and process the data. The guide specifies how to structure cancer pathology data using FHIR and draws on existing standards like the Standard for Sharing Cancer Data on FHIR and MedMorph to ensure compatibility with different systems, including pathology labs, hospitals and clinics (EHRs), and central cancer registries. The guide focuses on using structured data from electronic Cancer Protocols, which are digital checklists used by pathologists, to enable automated analysis and reporting. It acknowledges ongoing discussions about specific terminology choices and is primarily designed for the US healthcare context. While the guide offers a potential solution for more efficient data sharing in cancer care, it currently relies on specific data sources and may require further development to address broader needs.
