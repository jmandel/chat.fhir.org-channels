The HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide for Dental Data Exchange seeks to create a standardized method for sharing dental information electronically between medical and dental providers. It addresses the limitations of previous methods like paper forms and emails, which were inefficient and prone to errors. This Implementation Guide leverages FHIR to define how dental data should be structured and shared. It builds upon existing standards like the FHIR US Core and defines specialized profiles for dental information, such as dental referrals and treatment plans. Additionally, it provides guidance on using standardized codes for dental concepts and ensuring compatibility with different systems. By promoting the use of structured, machine-readable data, this Implementation Guide aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of dental data exchange, though its widespread adoption and impact on patient care remain to be seen.
