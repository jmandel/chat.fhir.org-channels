The FHIR Cow IG aims to improve how healthcare systems exchange information about orders, such as prescriptions or lab requests, between those who place the orders (like doctors) and those who fulfill them (like pharmacies or labs). It addresses the challenge of ensuring that order fillers receive all the necessary details to process orders accurately. The guide proposes three main methods for sharing order information: providing all required information upfront, enabling order fillers to request specific details through a standardized query process, and defining clear access permissions to ensure appropriate information sharing. The IG acknowledges that the type and amount of information needed can vary based on the order, the relationship between the ordering and fulfilling entities, and the specific clinical situation. It aims to create a standardized approach for handling order information, which can enhance compatibility between different healthcare systems and reduce confusion in order processing. By outlining these methods, the FHIR Cow IG seeks to improve the clarity and efficiency of order fulfillment in healthcare settings.
