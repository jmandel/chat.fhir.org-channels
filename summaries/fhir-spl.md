The FHIR Structured Product Labeling (SPL) IG defines a new method for submitting drug labels to the FDA using the FHIR standard. It aims to replace the older HL7 Version 3 SPL standard with a modern, interoperable approach. The guide achieves this by creating FHIR profiles that specify the necessary data elements for drug labels, mapping these elements to their counterparts in the older SPL format, and providing tools to automate the conversion between the two formats. The initial scope includes submissions for medicinal products and facility registrations, covering use cases like requesting National Drug Codes (NDC), registering establishments, and submitting drug labels. The guide leverages the FHIR "document" approach, using a structure called a Bundle to represent a complete SPL submission. It also utilizes other FHIR resources like Organization and MedicinalProductDefinition to represent specific entities. Notably, the guide focuses on human medicinal products and excludes areas like animal drugs or medical devices. Developed in collaboration with the HL7 Biomedical Research & Regulation work group, this IG seeks to standardize data exchange for drug label submissions to the FDA.
