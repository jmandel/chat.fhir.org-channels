This IG aims to standardize the creation and sharing of digital quality measures (dQMs), which are electronic rules used to assess healthcare quality. It addresses limitations of previous formats like the Health Quality Measures Format, which lacked the precision needed for electronic systems. The guide leverages FHIR and Clinical Quality Language (CQL), a language for expressing clinical logic. By combining FHIR and CQL, the IG enables the creation of dQMs that are machine-readable, shareable, and precise. The guide focuses on making dQMs computable to automate evaluation and reporting, aligning with existing standards for broader adoption. It also employs a layered approach to accommodate different implementation capabilities and provides guidance on managing medical terminologies and defining data requirements for dQM evaluation. While it promotes consistency and automation, the guide's reliance on specific technologies may present challenges for organizations lacking the necessary infrastructure or expertise. Overall, the IG aims to improve data collection, accuracy in quality reporting, and ultimately enhance healthcare quality, though its success depends on widespread adoption and effective implementation.
