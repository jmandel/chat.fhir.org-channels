**TL;DR:** This guide explains how to write down quality measures in a computer-friendly way using FHIR and a language called CQL.

The FHIR Quality Measure Implementation Guide (QM IG) helps healthcare professionals and software developers define and share quality measures in a standardized format. These measures assess healthcare quality by tracking things like whether patients receive recommended screenings or treatments. 

The guide focuses on using FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and CQL (Clinical Quality Language). FHIR is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically, and CQL is a special language for writing quality measures in a way that computers can understand. 

This guide ensures that quality measures are written in a consistent format, making it easier to compare performance between different healthcare providers or organizations. It also allows computers to automatically calculate quality scores from patient records, saving time and effort. The QM IG helps to improve healthcare quality by making it easier to track and measure performance.
