The CodeX™ Radiation Therapy IG aims to improve how radiation therapy information is shared between different computer systems in healthcare, such as EHRs and specialized oncology systems. Currently, these systems often store information in incompatible formats, making it difficult to exchange data. This IG leverages the FHIR standard to define a consistent way to represent and exchange information about radiation therapy treatments. By using FHIR resources and extensions, the IG enables the exchange of structured data about treatment prescriptions, plans, and summaries. The IG builds upon existing standards like minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) and aligns with specifications from Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise – Radiation Oncology (IHE-RO). It also adheres to US Core data standards, promoting broader interoperability. While the IG aims to facilitate automated data exchange and improve the accuracy of information sharing, its success depends on the adoption and implementation by various healthcare systems and software vendors.
