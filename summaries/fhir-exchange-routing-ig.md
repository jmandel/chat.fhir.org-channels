The FHIR Exchange Routing IG defines a standardized method for healthcare systems to exchange electronic health information using FHIR, even when intermediaries like clearinghouses or HIEs are involved. It aims to simplify the process for sending systems by allowing them to send FHIR requests as if they were communicating directly with the recipient, regardless of whether an intermediary is present. This approach, known as the "hybrid" model, relies on the recipient system having a public web address that senders always use. Intermediaries act passively, routing requests and responses without altering their content or participating in security measures like authentication. The guide supports standard FHIR data exchange methods and ensures that errors are communicated back to the sender consistently. This version focuses on passive intermediaries and assumes direct trust establishment between sender and receiver. It does not cover scenarios involving active intermediaries, trust mediated by intermediaries, or the FHIR Messaging framework. The guide's principles are applicable internationally and can be expanded in the future to accommodate additional scenarios and intermediary roles, promoting a flexible and scalable approach to FHIR-based health information exchange.
