**TL;DR:** This guide helps computer systems share information about a person's health and how well they can do everyday activities.

The Personal Functioning and Engagement (PFE) Implementation Guide (IG) helps computer systems share information about a person's ability to participate in everyday activities. This includes information about their physical health, mental health, and how well they can interact with their surroundings. 

This guide is important because it helps healthcare providers in different settings, like hospitals, nursing homes, and home health agencies, share information about a patient's functioning. This can lead to better care coordination and help patients recover and live more independently. For example, when a patient moves from a hospital to a nursing home, the nursing home can easily access the patient's records from the hospital and understand their needs.

This guide also defines specific categories of functioning, such as mobility, self-care, and mental functions. These categories help organize the information and make it easier for computer systems to understand and use.

While this guide helps share important information, it does not tell healthcare providers how to treat patients. It also does not provide guidance on how software systems should display the information. Those decisions are left to the healthcare providers and software developers.
