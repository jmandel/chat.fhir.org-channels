The Argo Continuous Glucose Monitoring IG seeks to standardize how continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data is shared between different computer systems like patient apps, EHR systems, and research databases. It addresses the current limitations of data sharing, such as manual processes and incompatible formats, which can lead to information being isolated in specific systems, inefficient workflows for healthcare providers, and difficulties in conducting large-scale research. The IG leverages the FHIR standard to establish a common data format and API for secure data exchange. It defines specific FHIR profiles for representing various types of CGM data and outlines a standardized workflow for data submission, including authorization, patient identification, and data preparation. Notably, the IG utilizes SMART Health Links for ad-hoc sharing with systems that may not have full FHIR integration. While aiming to use standardized codes for observations and reports, the IG acknowledges limitations in existing code sets and employs temporary solutions. It supports both scheduled and manual data submissions, offering flexibility for different use cases, and accommodates both tightly and loosely coupled system integrations through API-based and SMART Health Links approaches. By understanding the IG's design choices and capabilities, implementers can make informed decisions when developing systems for exchanging CGM data.
