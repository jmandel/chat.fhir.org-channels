The Validated Healthcare Directory (VHDir) IG seeks to create a standardized way to share healthcare provider information across different computer systems. It envisions a central source of provider data that is regularly verified and updated, eliminating the problems of outdated and inconsistent information found in existing, individually managed directories. VHDir uses the FHIR standard to define how this information is structured and exchanged. This includes detailed specifications for what data to include, how to search for specific providers, and how systems can request and receive data from the central directory. The guide prioritizes data accuracy through validation processes, such as providers confirming their own details and checking information against authoritative sources like licensing boards. VHDir aims to be adaptable for different regions and healthcare systems while also promoting data integrity. It focuses on how information is accessed from the central directory rather than dictating how the directory itself is built. While the guide doesn't currently include features like real-time updates, it acknowledges the potential need for such capabilities in the future.
