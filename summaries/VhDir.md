**TL;DR:** This guide helps create healthcare directories that let systems easily share information about healthcare providers and organizations. It uses a standard format so different computer systems can understand and use the data.

The Validated Healthcare Directory Implementation Guide (VHDir IG) defines a standard way to share information about healthcare providers, organizations, services, and their relationships. This guide focuses on making sure the data is accurate and can be easily exchanged between different computer systems, like those used by hospitals, insurance companies, and government agencies.

The VHDir IG addresses the need for reliable healthcare directory data by:
* **Standardizing data:** It uses FHIR, a widely recognized standard for healthcare information exchange, to ensure all systems use the same format.
* **Encouraging validation:** It includes methods for checking the accuracy of information against trusted sources, such as licensing boards.
* **Supporting various use cases:** The guide accommodates data needed for different purposes, including finding providers, checking insurance coverage, and coordinating patient care.

The guide describes how to share information about individual providers, organizations, the services they offer, the locations where they practice, and their relationships with insurance networks. It also explains how to record and share details about how data was checked for accuracy. While initially designed for a national healthcare directory, the guide can also be used for smaller directories or those with specific purposes.
