The FHIR-IPS IG defines a standardized way to create and share concise summaries of EHRs for patients needing unplanned care in international settings. This IG focuses on a core set of essential patient data, such as demographics, allergies, medical conditions, and medications, ensuring that healthcare providers in different countries can readily understand a patient's critical information regardless of their local EHR systems or languages. It achieves this by structuring the patient summary as a FHIR "bundle" containing a "composition" or main document, along with specific requirements for how different data elements are represented using standardized codes and terminology, notably SNOMED CT. The guide also addresses practical considerations like handling missing information and enabling the translation of human-readable summaries into multiple languages. By promoting the use of FHIR and standardized terminologies, the FHIR-IPS IG aims to improve the seamless exchange of vital patient information across borders, facilitating better care coordination for individuals in unplanned care situations.
