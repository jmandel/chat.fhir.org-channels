**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems share genetic test results and what they mean.

The Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide (IG) defines a standard way to exchange information about genetic testing using the FHIR standard. It covers different types of genetic tests, such as those that look for changes in single genes, groups of genes, or even entire chromosomes. The IG also defines how to share what those changes might mean for a patient's health, such as their risk of disease or how they might respond to certain medications.

This guide is important because it helps healthcare providers and systems share genetic information more easily. This can lead to better care for patients, as their doctors will have a more complete understanding of their genetic makeup. For example, a doctor could use a patient's genetic information to choose the best medication for them or to recommend preventive measures.

The IG also supports research by making it easier to collect and analyze large amounts of genetic data. This can lead to new discoveries about the causes of diseases and the development of new treatments.

While the IG provides a comprehensive framework for sharing genetic information, it is important to note that it does not cover every possible scenario. There may be some cases where additional information or context is needed to fully interpret genetic test results.
