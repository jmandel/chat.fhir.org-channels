The Genomics Reporting IG aims to standardize the electronic exchange of genetic test results, improving communication in genomic medicine. It establishes a common language for describing genetic variations, their potential effects, and related information like molecular biomarkers. The guide leverages FHIR to structure data in a consistent, machine-readable way, making it easier to share information between laboratories, doctors, researchers, and patients. It builds upon existing standards and terminologies in genomics while addressing limitations of older systems, such as inconsistent use of codes and difficulties representing complex relationships. The guide provides specific instructions for representing diverse genomic information, including pharmacogenomics (how genes affect drug response), and enables standardized queries for retrieving and processing this data. It acknowledges the evolving nature of genomics and allows for extensions to accommodate new knowledge. By promoting interoperability, the guide seeks to facilitate the integration of genomic data into clinical workflows, ultimately supporting better patient care and research advancements.
