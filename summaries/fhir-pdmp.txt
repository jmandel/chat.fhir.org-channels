**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare providers easily access and share patient prescription information to improve patient safety.

The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) FHIR Implementation Guide helps healthcare providers get a patient's prescription history for controlled substances from state-run databases called Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs). 

Using a standard format called FHIR, this guide enables electronic health records (EHRs) and pharmacy systems to talk to PDMPs. This means providers can directly request and receive a patient's prescription history from within their usual workflow. The guide allows for different ways to send and receive this information, including discrete data for additional analysis and direct links to formatted reports. 

This helps providers make better decisions about prescribing medications, avoid misuse, and ultimately improve patient care and safety.  The guide focuses only on getting prescription information to providers; other processes, such as sending prescriptions to pharmacies or reporting dispensations to PDMPs, are outside its scope.
