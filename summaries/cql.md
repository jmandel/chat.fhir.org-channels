This IG focuses on standardizing how clinical knowledge, such as guidelines for medical decisions and healthcare performance evaluations, is written and shared electronically. Currently, inconsistent methods for representing this knowledge hinder its widespread use and exchange between different computer systems. This IG introduces the Clinical Quality Language (CQL), a human-readable language for writing clinical knowledge, and the Expression Logical Model (ELM), a machine-readable format for that knowledge. CQL is translated into ELM, enabling knowledge sharing across systems regardless of the original language. This approach offers flexibility by being compatible with various data models and aligning with existing standards like the Health Quality Measures Format and the Knowledge Artifact Specification. Notably, CQL integrates with FHIR and utilizes FHIRPath, a language for navigating FHIR data. However, the IG acknowledges that implementation variations are possible due to optional features, and the interpretation of knowledge can change over time depending on how medical terminology is updated. The evaluation of CQL expressions also depends on the specific context, such as the patient or practitioner involved.
