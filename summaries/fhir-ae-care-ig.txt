**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare providers use a standard way to share information about bad events that happen during medical care. It focuses on making it easier to report and track these events to improve patient safety.

The Adverse Event Clinical Care Implementation Guide (IG) defines a standard way to record and share information about adverse events, also known as harmful or unexpected incidents, that occur during medical care. This guide specifically focuses on how healthcare providers can use this standard in clinical settings, such as when reporting incidents.

The IG addresses the need for better communication and tracking of adverse events. By using a common format, healthcare providers can easily share information about these events with each other and with organizations that collect this data. This can help to identify patterns and trends in adverse events, leading to improvements in patient safety.

The guide provides examples of how to record information about different types of adverse events, including those that result from medication errors, medical devices, or problems during procedures. It also shows how to record information about the people involved in the event, the severity of the event, and any actions taken to mitigate the harm.

By using the standard defined in this guide, healthcare providers can improve the quality and safety of patient care. The guide helps to ensure that information about adverse events is collected and shared in a consistent and reliable way, which can help to prevent future incidents and improve patient outcomes.
