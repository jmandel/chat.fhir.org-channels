**TL;DR:** This guide explains how to use a standardized set of healthcare information, called the International Patient Summary (IPS), to share key details about a patient's health across different healthcare systems, especially in unplanned care situations.

The International Patient Summary (IPS) Implementation Guide specifies how electronic health records can be extracted and organized for sharing essential patient health information across different systems. The IPS is designed to be minimal, meaning it focuses on the most important information needed for general clinical care. It is also non-exhaustive, recognizing that additional data may be needed in certain situations. 

This guide is particularly useful for unplanned care scenarios, such as when a patient needs medical attention while traveling in another country. The IPS helps healthcare providers quickly understand a patient's medical history, allergies, medications, and problems, even if they don't have access to the patient's full medical record. The guide also addresses the need for language translation in cross-border care, ensuring that the summary can be understood by healthcare providers in different countries.

While the IPS is designed to be universal, this guide acknowledges that specific needs and practices may vary across different regions. It allows for flexibility in how the summary is generated and shared, while still adhering to a core set of data elements required for basic clinical understanding. The guide also recognizes the importance of patient privacy and security, providing considerations for protecting sensitive health information during exchange.
