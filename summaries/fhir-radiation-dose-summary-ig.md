The Radiation Dose Summary IG provides a standardized method for computer systems to exchange summaries of radiation doses patients receive during medical imaging exams like Computed Tomography (CT) scans, X-rays, and Nuclear Medicine procedures. It addresses the challenge of accessing essential dose information from systems that collect and manage this data, such as Radiology Information Systems, and making it readily available to other systems, such as EHRs. Previously, detailed dose information was often stored in a complex format called DICOM Radiation Structured Reports, which many systems could not easily interpret. This IG leverages a modern standard for exchanging healthcare information called FHIR to define a simpler and more accessible way to represent these summaries. It specifies how standard FHIR components should be used to structure the dose data, making it easier for systems like EHRs to retrieve and display this information in patient reports or potentially use it for other purposes like tracking radiation exposure over time. However, it is important to note that this guide focuses on summarizing doses per exam, not cumulative doses, and does not address radiation therapy or doses received by healthcare practitioners.
