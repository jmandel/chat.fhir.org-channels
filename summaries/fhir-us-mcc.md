The US Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC) IG aims to enhance healthcare for patients with multiple chronic conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, by improving how electronic systems share and utilize patient health information. It provides a standardized method for creating electronic care plans that can gather data from various healthcare providers and systems, enabling a comprehensive view of the patient's health. This allows healthcare teams to develop personalized care plans, track patient progress, and facilitate better communication with patients and caregivers. The guide utilizes the FHIR standard to structure and exchange care plan information, employing standardized terminology and building upon existing US Core FHIR profiles. It focuses specifically on the needs of patients in the US healthcare system with multiple chronic conditions and suggests using specific tools for structured data capture and incorporating patient-generated data through questionnaires. The guide's development is driven by factors such as the increasing prevalence of multiple chronic conditions, a growing aging population, and a focus on patient-centered care. While the guide promotes interoperability, it's worth noting that implementation requires access to the Value Set Authority Center for terminology codes, which necessitates a Unified Medical Language System license.
