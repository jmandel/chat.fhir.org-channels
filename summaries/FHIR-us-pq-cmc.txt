**TL;DR:** This guide helps drug companies send information about the quality of their drugs to the FDA in a computer-friendly way.

The *US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pharmaceutical Quality/Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (PQ/CMC) Implementation Guide* defines how drug companies should organize data about their drugs when submitting it to the FDA for review. This includes information about the ingredients, manufacturing process, and quality testing of drug products. 

The guide uses a standardized format called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) to structure the data. This makes it easier for the FDA's computer systems to process and understand the information, leading to more efficient drug reviews. The guide is being implemented in stages, with the initial focus on common types of pills taken by mouth.  Future versions will include other drug forms.

The guide also includes instructions for creating a human-readable version of the data that is easy for people to understand. This helps ensure that everyone involved, both at the drug company and the FDA, can access and interpret the information correctly. This guide plays a key role in modernizing drug applications to the FDA, making the process faster and more reliable.
