This IG enables older systems using FHIR, versions R4 and R4B, to adopt a newer method for receiving updates called "topic-based subscriptions." Previously, these systems relied on a less efficient "query-based" approach. This new method allows applications to subscribe to specific types of changes in healthcare data, like a new patient registration or an updated medication order, and receive notifications when those changes occur. The IG defines how these subscriptions are created and managed, including the format of the notifications. It supports various communication methods like webhooks, email, and dedicated messaging systems, offering flexibility for different systems. Clients can also specify the level of detail included in the notifications, choosing to receive only identifiers, full resource details, or no content at all. The guide also addresses error handling and security considerations, ensuring reliable and secure communication. It allows clients to request notifications formatted in different FHIR versions, facilitating system upgrades and interoperability between systems using different FHIR versions. By adopting this IG, older FHIR systems can improve their efficiency and responsiveness to changes in healthcare data.
