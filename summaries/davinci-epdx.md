The Da Vinci Payer Data Exchange (PDex) IG aims to improve how payers and healthcare providers share patient health information, as well as how payers share data amongst themselves with patient consent. It uses a standardized approach based on FHIR. Currently, data exchange often relies on outdated methods like fax and mail, leading to slow and potentially inaccurate information sharing. PDex defines how payers should format common types of patient data like allergies and medications according to national standards. It also specifies how this data can be securely accessed through computer systems using APIs and how to manage patient consent. While PDex aims for broad compatibility, it acknowledges that some systems may not fully support the latest FHIR version and offers ways to handle these situations. The guide also emphasizes secure data transfer and plans to transition to newer, more robust security frameworks in the future. PDex is still under development and will be refined based on real-world implementation experiences.
