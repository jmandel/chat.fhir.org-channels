The HL7 At-Home In-Vitro Test Reporting IG aims to create a standardized way to digitally share at-home test results, like those for COVID-19, with healthcare providers and public health agencies. It focuses on enabling app developers to send these results in FHIR, which allows different health systems to easily understand and use the information. The IG achieves this by defining specific formats for packaging test results and related information, such as patient responses to in-app questions, into a single digital message. It also provides a framework for creating formats tailored to specific tests, starting with COVID-19 as an example. To accommodate older systems, the IG includes instructions for converting the new FHIR format into the older HL7v2 format. The IG primarily focuses on reporting single test results and leverages existing standards for identifying tests and applications. It also addresses the need for recording past test results when individuals take multiple tests over time. While the IG establishes a framework for sharing at-home test results, widespread adoption will depend on the ability of public health agencies and healthcare systems to receive and process data in the FHIR format.
