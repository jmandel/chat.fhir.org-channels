The Order Catalog IG defines a standardized way to represent and exchange information about medical products, such as medications and devices, using FHIR. This allows different EHR systems and other healthcare applications to easily share and understand product information, which can improve tasks like browsing catalogs, searching for specific products, and accessing detailed product descriptions. The IG achieves this by using FHIR resources like Composition, DeviceDefinition, and MedicationKnowledge to structure catalog information. It provides ways to represent entire catalogs and individual product details, including device characteristics and medication usage information. The IG also supports efficient searching within catalogs and offers flexibility in how catalogs are structured and accessed. Additionally, it considers jurisdictional differences in device regulations by including mappings to databases like the Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) in the United States and the European Union Medical Device Regulation database (EUDAMED). By promoting a common way to represent medical product catalogs, the Order Catalog IG aims to improve the interoperability and exchange of product information across healthcare systems.
