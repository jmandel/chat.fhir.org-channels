The FHIR IG for Canonical Resource Management Infrastructure aims to improve the management and sharing of healthcare knowledge artifacts like questionnaires, clinical guidelines, and quality measures. These artifacts are often built using medical terminologies that change over time, leading to potential inconsistencies. The IG introduces standardized ways to package these artifacts with clear information about their dependencies, including specific versions of terminologies. This ensures that everyone using an artifact, such as EHR systems, understands its content and intended use, even as terminologies evolve. The IG also defines ways to create packages tailored to specific needs, for example, by including only necessary components or adapting to environments with limited access to terminology services. Additionally, it proposes standard ways for systems to store and share these artifacts, promoting interoperability between different platforms. While the IG aims to improve consistency and reliability, it's important to note that widespread adoption and implementation are needed to realize these potential benefits. The IG does not mandate a central authority for managing artifacts, instead encouraging a decentralized ecosystem of interoperable repositories, which may pose challenges for coordination and governance.
