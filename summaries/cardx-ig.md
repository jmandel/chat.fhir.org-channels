The CardX Hypertension Management IG aims to enhance how hypertension is diagnosed and managed. It focuses on enabling the seamless and standardized exchange of SMBP. The IG achieves this by defining FHIR profiles for structuring SMBP data, including readings, measurement times, and patient identifiers. These profiles ensure that data is consistently formatted, allowing different systems like blood pressure devices, health apps, and EHRs to understand and exchange information. The IG leverages the FHIR standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. By promoting interoperability, the IG aims to improve the quality and frequency of data available to healthcare professionals, enabling more effective monitoring of patients' blood pressure, timely adjustments to treatment plans, and ultimately, better management of hypertension. While the IG focuses on core SMBP data exchange, it acknowledges that future versions might incorporate additional data elements and functionalities to support more comprehensive hypertension care. It builds upon existing standards and aligns with established hypertension management guidelines, emphasizing patient involvement and a vendor-neutral approach to ensure broad applicability across various healthcare settings and technologies.
