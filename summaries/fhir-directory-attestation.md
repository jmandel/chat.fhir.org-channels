The National Directory Attestation and Verification IG aims to improve how healthcare provider information is managed and shared across the US healthcare system. It addresses the current challenges of fragmented and inaccurate provider directories by establishing a standardized way to exchange information using a common set of rules and definitions. This IG leverages FHIR to define how information about healthcare providers, organizations, services, and insurance networks should be structured and transmitted. The guide promotes using secure, web-based communication (through APIs) to submit, validate, and verify provider data. It acknowledges the need for flexibility in how organizations attest to and verify information, recognizing that different stakeholders may have varying roles and processes. Additionally, the IG considers the sensitive nature of some directory information and includes guidance on managing data access and privacy. By promoting standardization and interoperability, the IG seeks to reduce the administrative burden and costs associated with managing provider directories, while also improving the accuracy and reliability of the information available to healthcare stakeholders.
