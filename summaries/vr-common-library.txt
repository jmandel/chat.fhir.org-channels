## Vital Records Common Library Implementation Guide - Summary for Non-Experts

**TL;DR:** This guide helps different health information systems share vital records data such as birth, death, and fetal death information. It defines standard ways to represent common information like names, addresses, birthplaces, education levels, and race and ethnicity, making it easier for systems to understand and exchange this data.

The Vital Records Common Library (VRCL) Implementation Guide focuses on improving how different healthcare applications share important information related to vital records. It defines a set of standardized building blocks using the FHIR standard, which are then used by other, more specialized guides like the Birth and Fetal Death Reporting (BFDR) and Vital Records Death Reporting (VRDR) guides. 

This guide does not tell you how to send or receive vital records, but rather provides the building blocks for other guides to use. It includes:

* **Profiles:** These act like templates that define what information should be included when representing things like the patient (e.g., mother, child, decedent) or practitioner.
* **Extensions:** These add extra pieces of information to existing data elements, such as details about a person's birthplace or the reason why certain data might be missing.
* **Code Systems and Value Sets:** These provide standardized lists of codes and terms for specific information, like race and ethnicity categories or education levels. 

By using these building blocks, different healthcare systems can ensure that they are speaking the same language when exchanging vital records data, leading to more accurate and efficient data sharing. This is particularly important for public health agencies that need to collect and analyze this information.
