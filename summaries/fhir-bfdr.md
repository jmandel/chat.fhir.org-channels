**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare providers and government agencies share information about births and fetal deaths.

The Birth and Fetal Death Reporting (BFDR) Implementation Guide (IG) defines a standard way to exchange data about births and fetal deaths electronically. It covers information typically found on birth certificates and fetal death reports, such as the baby's name, birth weight, and the parents' demographics. The guide also includes details about the mother's pregnancy, including risk factors, infections, and procedures.

This guide is important because it helps healthcare providers send information to state and national agencies efficiently and accurately. By using a standard format, the data can be easily understood and used for important tasks such as tracking birth rates, identifying health trends, and issuing birth certificates.

While the guide aims to cover all essential data elements, some information may not be captured electronically, and some states may have specific requirements not covered by the standard. The guide also acknowledges that electronic systems may use different ways to link a mother's record to her baby's record, which could impact data retrieval.
