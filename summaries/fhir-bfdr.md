The Birth and Fetal Death Reporting (BFDR) IG establishes a standardized method for exchanging electronic birth and fetal death records among healthcare providers, state vital records offices, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using FHIR. It aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of reporting by defining how specific data elements should be structured and transmitted. The guide utilizes FHIR resources like "bundles" to package the report and associated information and "compositions" to specify the content's organization. To handle situations where standard options don't apply, it introduces categories with codes that allow for indicating the absence of certain conditions or procedures. The guide also incorporates mechanisms for data validation and clarifies how to represent complex scenarios like mother-baby relationships and multiple births. While the BFDR IG aims for comprehensive data exchange, it acknowledges that individual recipients may have unique requirements for completeness. Conformance to the guide ensures standardized formatting but does not guarantee a successful transmission, as the document must also adhere to the recipient's specific business rules. The guide clarifies how missing data should be interpreted, promoting consistent understanding across different systems.
