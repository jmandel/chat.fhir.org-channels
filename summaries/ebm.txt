**TL;DR:** This guide helps computers share scientific information about medicines and treatments.

The Evidence Based Medicine on FHIR (EBMonFHIR) Implementation Guide defines how to use the FHIR standard to share scientific knowledge about medicines. This includes information about research studies, the results of those studies, and recommendations for treatments. 

This guide is important because it can help healthcare providers make better decisions about patient care. By using a common standard to share information, healthcare providers can access the latest scientific evidence from a variety of sources. This can help them choose the best treatments for their patients and avoid treatments that may not be effective or may even be harmful.

The guide also helps researchers share their findings with others. This can help accelerate the pace of medical research and lead to new discoveries.

The EBMonFHIR Implementation Guide is a complex document that is intended for developers of health information systems. However, the concepts it describes are important for everyone to understand. By using a common standard to share information, we can make sure that everyone has access to the latest scientific evidence about medicines and treatments.
