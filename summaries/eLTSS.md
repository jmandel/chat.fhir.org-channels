The eLTSS IG aims to enhance how EHR systems manage information related to long-term services and supports (LTSS), which are a range of services that help individuals with chronic illnesses or disabilities live independently. It achieves this by standardizing the structure and exchange of LTSS data between different computer systems using the FHIR standard. The guide specifies how to represent key LTSS data elements consistently, enabling seamless sharing of information between healthcare providers, caregivers, and patients. It also aligns with other important health data initiatives, such as the US Core FHIR profiles, and promotes patient-centered care by incorporating mechanisms to capture patient preferences and goals. While the eLTSS IG facilitates better care coordination and improves interoperability for LTSS data, it's important to note that its successful implementation depends on the adoption and integration within various EHR systems. Additionally, the guide primarily focuses on technical aspects of data exchange and may require further development to address broader challenges related to LTSS care delivery.
