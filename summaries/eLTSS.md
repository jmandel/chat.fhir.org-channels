**TL;DR:** This guide helps computers share information about long-term services and supports (LTSS) for people who need help with daily activities.

The eLTSS Implementation Guide (IG) explains how to use a standardized format called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) to exchange information about LTSS. It focuses on creating care plans that outline a person's needs, goals, and the services they receive. 

This guide is important because it helps different computer systems, like those used by healthcare providers, state agencies, and insurance companies, understand and share LTSS information. This makes it easier to coordinate care for people who need LTSS. 

The guide explains how to represent different parts of a care plan, such as the person's goals, the services they need, who is providing those services, and how much they cost. It also includes ways to track a person's progress and to record agreements and signatures related to the plan. 

By using this guide, healthcare providers can more easily share information about LTSS, which can lead to better care for people who need it.
