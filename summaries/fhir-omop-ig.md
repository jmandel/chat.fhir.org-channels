The FHIR to Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) IG provides a standardized method for converting EHR data from the FHIR format into the OMOP format, which is widely used in medical research. This IG focuses on streamlining the process of transferring data from systems using FHIR to those using OMOP, addressing a previous gap in interoperability efforts that primarily focused on the reverse direction. It achieves this by defining clear mappings between FHIR resources and OMOP data tables, along with instructions and tools for handling different data types and code systems. The guide leverages existing standards and resources like the OMOP Common Data Model version 5.4 and the International Patient Access FHIR profiles, concentrating on a core set of common EHR data elements. This approach aims to reduce the time and effort required for data transformation, improve data quality and consistency, and ultimately facilitate research by enabling easier access to and analysis of data from diverse sources. The guide's development was informed by the Vulcan FHIR Accelerator project, emphasizing community collaboration and practical applicability for a wider impact.
