The Data Segmentation for Privacy (DS4P) IG defines a standardized way to label sensitive health information within FHIR. This allows healthcare providers to share information more easily while protecting specific parts of a patient's record, such as a social security number, rather than treating the entire record as equally sensitive. The IG expands on FHIR's existing capabilities by introducing standardized extensions to add details like the policy behind a label, who assigned it, and related documents. It also enables applying labels to specific data elements within a record and representing the highest sensitivity level of a collection of records. Standardized codes are provided for common sensitivity levels, purposes of use like treatment or research, and obligations for handling the data. The IG also describes a conceptual Security Labeling Service that can automatically assign labels based on policies. While aiming for broad applicability, the current version primarily uses examples from the US healthcare system and emphasizes the importance of trust agreements between those sharing and receiving information. The IG is intended as a foundation for more specific guides tailored to particular use cases and policy environments.
