This IG establishes a standardized way to exchange healthcare information more comprehensively by defining custom extensions, providing standard terminology, and defining validation rules within the FHIR framework. Custom extensions allow the inclusion of additional information not part of the core FHIR specification, enabling more detailed data exchange within EHRs. To ensure consistent meaning and interpretation of healthcare data, the IG introduces code systems and value sets, which are collections of codes used to represent medical concepts like diagnoses or procedures. Additionally, the guide outlines how to create custom validation rules for questionnaires, ensuring data quality and consistency by specifying criteria that the data must meet. This is achieved through a central registry for extensions, standardized terminology resources, and leveraging FHIR's constraint framework for defining validation rules. By adhering to this IG, healthcare systems can improve data exchange, reduce ambiguity, and enhance the quality and consistency of information shared between different EHR systems.
