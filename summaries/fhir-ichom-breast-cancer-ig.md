**TL;DR:** This guide helps computer systems share information about breast cancer patients in a standardized way.

The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) Breast Cancer Implementation Guide defines a way to represent information about breast cancer patients using the FHIR standard. This makes it easier for different computer systems, like electronic health records and patient portals, to share this information.

The guide includes two ways to represent the same data: as questionnaires and as individual data elements. Questionnaires can be used to collect information directly from patients or clinicians. Individual data elements can be used to store information in a more structured way, making it easier to analyze.

This implementation guide doesn't focus on specific ways to use the data, like tracking outcomes or comparing different treatments. Instead, it provides a foundation for other developers to build upon, creating tools that can improve care for breast cancer patients. 

For example, developers could use this guide to create applications that help healthcare providers track patient outcomes, compare their performance to other providers, or make more informed treatment decisions.
