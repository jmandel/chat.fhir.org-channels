The ICHOM Breast Cancer IG aims to standardize how EHR systems store and share breast cancer treatment outcome data. It structures information like patient demographics, tumor details, treatment history, and patient-reported outcomes using the FHIR standard. The IG uses FHIR questionnaires to collect patient and clinician reported outcomes and maps data from the ICHOM Breast Cancer Set to specific FHIR resources like Patient and Condition. This allows for detailed representation of clinical information. Additionally, the IG uses standard medical terminologies to ensure data consistency across systems. The IG focuses on data representation and does not define how this data should be used or exchanged. It aligns with other relevant FHIR standards to promote compatibility. While the IG does not specify security measures, implementers are responsible for secure data handling. By providing a standardized structure for breast cancer outcome data, this IG aims to improve data sharing and comparison, potentially enhancing care quality and patient outcomes.
