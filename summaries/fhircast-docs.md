The FHIRcast IG defines a standard approach for synchronizing healthcare applications in real time. This means that when a user interacts with different healthcare apps, such as an EHR or a medical imaging system, all applications will display the same patient or clinical information simultaneously. FHIRcast uses a central coordinator, called a "Hub," which manages subscriptions from different applications and broadcasts events when changes occur. For instance, if a doctor opens a patient's chart in one application, the Hub sends a notification to all other subscribed applications, ensuring they also display the same patient's information. FHIRcast leverages existing web technologies like WebSockets and the SMART on FHIR authorization framework to enable secure and efficient communication between applications. It also defines an Event Maturity Model to ensure that new events are thoroughly tested and vetted by the community before widespread adoption. FHIRcast also addresses challenges like managing multiple open applications and recovering from synchronization errors, providing guidance on how applications should behave in these situations. By standardizing how healthcare applications share context and synchronize information, FHIRcast aims to improve clinician workflow and reduce the risk of errors caused by outdated or inconsistent information.
