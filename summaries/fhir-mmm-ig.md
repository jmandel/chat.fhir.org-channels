The Longitudinal Maternal & Child Health Information for Research FHIR IG aims to improve research on maternal and child health by standardizing how this clinical information is shared and accessed. It provides a common framework for representing and exchanging data about pregnant individuals and their children using the FHIR standard. The IG leverages existing standards like the US Core profiles and defines a process where researchers can query EHR systems and other data sources for specific information, such as details on individuals who died within a year of pregnancy or those with high blood pressure during pregnancy. Researchers can then use this standardized data to investigate factors related to maternal mortality and child health outcomes. The IG focuses specifically on maternal care during pregnancy and after delivery, including the period before pregnancy, and emphasizes the importance of linking maternal and child health records to study their interconnectedness. This initiative responds to the critical need for better data sharing and standardization in maternal health research, particularly given the rising maternal mortality rates.
