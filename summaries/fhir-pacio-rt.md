This IG defines a standardized way to organize healthcare data for patients receiving long-term care, such as in home health or skilled nursing facilities. It addresses the challenge of managing large amounts of data that accumulate during extended care admissions by introducing the concept of "re-assessment timepoints." These timepoints, determined by formal assessments conducted at specific intervals, divide the overall admission into smaller, manageable periods. Each timepoint is represented as a separate encounter within the patient's EHR, creating a chronological timeline of the patient's care journey. By linking clinical data, such as observations and diagnoses, to specific timepoints, the IG enables easier access to relevant information for a particular period, improving the efficiency of data retrieval and analysis. The guide focuses on post-acute care settings where extended admissions are common and utilizes the FHIR standard for data exchange. It also defines search parameters to facilitate querying for specific timepoints based on criteria like the patient, date range, or assessment type, enhancing the usability of patient data for clinicians, insurance providers, and other stakeholders. The IG aligns with the US Core IG, ensuring compatibility with existing healthcare data exchange standards in the United States.
