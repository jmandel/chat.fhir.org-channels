**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems share information about COVID-19 in a standard way.

The COVID-19 FHIR Profile Library Implementation Guide (IG) is a collection of data elements related to COVID-19.  It is meant to be a resource for other groups creating their own guides for specific COVID-19 use cases, such as public health reporting or research. This ensures that different systems use the same definitions and structure for COVID-19 information, making it easier to share and analyze.

The guide includes profiles for:
- **Lab tests:** These profiles specify how to record and transmit results for various COVID-19 lab tests, including those that detect the virus, antibodies, and other related markers.
- **Exposure and travel history:** These profiles capture information about a person's potential exposure to COVID-19, including whether they have been in close contact with someone infected or have traveled to areas with high infection rates.
- **Signs, symptoms, diagnoses, and underlying conditions:** These profiles capture information about a patient's health status related to COVID-19, including their symptoms, diagnoses, and any pre-existing medical conditions that might affect their risk or outcome.
- **COVID-19 Immunization:** This profile captures information about a person's vaccination status for COVID-19, including the type of vaccine, the date administered, and the manufacturer.

This guide does not cover electronic case reporting to public health authorities. Other resources should be used for that purpose. 

This IG is a collaborative effort involving many organizations and individuals, including the CDC, HL7, and others. It aims to promote consistency and avoid duplication of effort in representing COVID-19 data using FHIR.
