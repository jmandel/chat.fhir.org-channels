The COVID-19 Library IG offers a standardized way to exchange information about COVID-19 electronically, aiming to improve patient care, public health reporting, and research. This IG does not define how to send data for official case reporting to public health agencies, nor is it designed for one specific use case. Instead, it acts as a library of standard data elements, including templates for specific types of data like laboratory results and lists of standardized codes for symptoms or diagnoses, which can be used in various situations like research or billing. Built using the FHIR standard, it draws upon existing standards such as the United States Core Data for Interoperability (US Core) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Electronic Initial Case Report (eICR) IG to ensure compatibility. Developed with input from various organizations, it is intended to be open and collaborative, allowing the guide to adapt over time based on user needs and feedback.
