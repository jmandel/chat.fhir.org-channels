**TL;DR:** This guide defines how to create, share, and use digital healthcare instructions.

The Canonical Resource Management Infrastructure (CRMI) Implementation Guide establishes a common framework for handling digital healthcare instructions, such as questionnaires, guidelines, and quality measures. It ensures these instructions can be easily created, shared between different computer systems, and used reliably over time.

This guide addresses the need for consistent healthcare instructions by defining clear rules for how these instructions should be structured and organized. It also provides ways to package and distribute these instructions, ensuring they include all necessary components and remain compatible with different software systems.

A key challenge addressed by the CRMI is managing changes to medical terminologies, which are used to represent medical concepts in a standardized way. This guide introduces "version manifests," which act like a table of contents, specifying the exact versions of medical terms used in each set of instructions. This ensures that instructions remain consistent and produce reliable results even as medical terminologies evolve.

The CRMI aims to create an ecosystem where digital healthcare instructions can be easily accessed and used by various healthcare systems, including those used by doctors, hospitals, and public health agencies. This promotes collaboration, improves the quality of healthcare data, and supports better decision-making in healthcare.
