The PACIO Cognitive Status IG aims to improve the sharing of information about a patient's cognitive abilities between different healthcare providers. It addresses the problem of inconsistent information exchange during transitions between care settings, such as when a patient moves from a hospital to a nursing home. The IG leverages FHIR to define a common format for representing cognitive assessments. This means that different EHR systems can understand and share this information. The guide focuses on standardizing data from commonly used assessment tools and promotes the use of established coding systems. While initially focused on post-acute care settings like nursing homes, the IG is designed to be adaptable and could potentially expand to other areas of healthcare. It also emphasizes the importance of data security and patient privacy, supporting secure data sharing mechanisms and patient access to their own information.
