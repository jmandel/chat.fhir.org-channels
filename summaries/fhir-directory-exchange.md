The National Healthcare Directory IG aims to improve the sharing of healthcare provider information by creating a standardized way for a central directory to exchange data with local healthcare systems, such as those used by hospitals, clinics, insurance companies, and health information exchanges. It addresses the challenges of outdated and inconsistent information caused by traditional methods that require providers to register with multiple, separate directories. The guide utilizes the FHIR standard to define how specific information about healthcare providers, organizations, and locations should be structured and shared. This includes defining the essential data elements that should be included and how to search for specific information. The guide promotes using a central directory that verifies information against authoritative sources like state licensing boards and then makes it available to other systems through a standardized API. It also considers the need to include a broad range of healthcare providers and support staff, not just doctors, and addresses how to handle sensitive information and potential data inconsistencies. While designed with a national system in mind, the guide's principles can also be applied to smaller, regional directories.
