The mCODE IG aims to improve the way EHRs handle cancer patient information. It creates a standard format for storing and sharing this data, which has historically been difficult because different health systems used different methods. mCODE achieves standardization by defining how to represent key pieces of cancer patient information, like diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes, using FHIR. It draws on existing medical terminologies to ensure consistency and makes sure it aligns with broader health data standards in the United States. mCODE also addresses specific needs in oncology, like representing different cancer staging systems and incorporating genomic data. It focuses on a core set of essential information rather than trying to capture everything, making it more practical to implement. The guide was developed with input from doctors, technology experts, and EHR vendors to ensure it is both useful and feasible to put into practice. By making cancer data easier to share and analyze, mCODE aims to support better cancer care and research.
