**TL;DR:** This guide helps standardize how information about sick travelers is shared, which is important for controlling the spread of diseases.

The Report of Ill Travelers Implementation Guide (IG) aims to create a standard way to share information about travelers who become sick with infectious diseases, especially when traveling by air. This is important for public health agencies like the CDC to track and control the spread of diseases.

Currently, the way information is shared between different health departments and agencies is often done manually and isn't always consistent. This IG seeks to improve this process by using a common language and format for sharing data, specifically using the FHIR standard.

The guide defines ways to report information about the sick traveler, including their symptoms, diagnoses, lab results, and travel details like flight information. It also includes standard codes for things like diseases, symptoms, and airports. This helps ensure everyone is using the same terms and definitions, making it easier to share and analyze information.

By using a standard approach like the one described in this IG, public health officials can more quickly identify and respond to potential outbreaks of infectious diseases, ultimately helping to protect the health of communities. The IG will also make it easier to share information internationally, which is important for controlling the global spread of diseases.

This IG is designed to work with the CDC's systems for collecting public health information, making it a key part of efforts to modernize and improve disease surveillance. It is intended to be used by a variety of groups involved in public health, including state and local health departments, hospitals, and organizations involved in international travel.
