The PACIO Advance Directive Interoperability (ADI) IG aims to improve how healthcare systems manage advance directives, which are documents outlining a person's wishes for medical care if they cannot communicate them. Traditionally, these were paper-based, leading to difficulties in locating, verifying, and sharing them between healthcare providers. This IG uses a standardized digital format to address these challenges. It allows advance directives to be securely stored, updated, and accessed electronically by authorized individuals and systems. It supports various document types, including scanned paper directives and digital ones created directly within the system. The guide also helps manage different versions of a directive and ensures it can be easily found when needed. While it initially focuses on directives created by patients themselves and portable medical orders, future versions may address instructions given during medical encounters. The guide is designed to work with existing health data standards in the US and recognizes that specific requirements for advance directives can vary by location.
