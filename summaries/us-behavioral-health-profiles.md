## US Behavioral Health Implementation Guide: Sharing Mental Health Data

**TL;DR:** This guide helps electronic health records (EHRs) share important information about mental health. It explains how to organize and send data like diagnoses, medications, and social factors in a standard way. This makes it easier for different healthcare systems to work together and provide better care for patients with mental health needs.

The US Behavioral Health Implementation Guide (IG) uses a common language called FHIR to improve how mental health data is shared between different parts of the healthcare system. This includes information about patient demographics, diagnoses, medications, treatments, social determinants of health (SDOH), and more. 

The guide focuses on standardizing this information, making sure it's organized and sent in a consistent format. This makes it easier for EHRs in hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare settings to understand and use the data.  

For example, the IG explains how to record details about a patient’s preferred name and pronouns, which is important for providing respectful care. It also outlines how to share information about a patient’s social needs, like access to food or transportation, which can significantly affect their mental health.

The IG recognizes that there are many different ways to assess mental health. It recommends using standard coding systems whenever possible but acknowledges that some common assessments are not yet standardized.  

This guide is primarily for technical experts who build and manage EHR systems. However, it can also be helpful for researchers, policymakers, and others interested in understanding how technology can support better mental healthcare. By making it easier to share mental health information, the IG aims to improve care coordination and ultimately help people get the treatment and support they need.
