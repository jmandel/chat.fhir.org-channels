The US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Plus Behavioral Health (BH) IG aims to standardize and improve the sharing of behavioral health information between healthcare systems in the United States. It establishes a common set of data elements, called the USCDI+ BH dataset, specifically focused on adult patients with mental health and substance use disorders. This guide utilizes the FHIR standard to define how these data elements should be structured and shared. It builds upon the existing US Core IG and leverages FHIR profiles to ensure consistency and compatibility with other healthcare data. The guide also addresses the management of various clinical documents, including PDFs and scanned records, using the DocumentReference FHIR resource. While it acknowledges challenges in standardizing assessments and the limitations posed by proprietary assessments, the guide represents a collaborative effort involving clinicians, patients, developers, and policymakers to improve the interoperability of behavioral health information and align with reporting requirements from agencies like the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
