The Military Service History and Status IG defines a standardized way to exchange information about a person's military service using FHIR. It aims to improve healthcare for veterans by enabling healthcare providers, veterans, and other organizations to easily access and share military service information, such as deployments and job roles. Previously, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) relied on a custom system that was difficult for other systems to interact with. This new guide leverages FHIR profiles to specify the necessary data elements for representing military service information, extensions to add data to existing records, and standardized terminologies to ensure clear communication between systems. It also defines a FHIR-based API to verify veteran status and retrieve military history, replacing the older VA system. The guide focuses on sharing information for administrative and clinical purposes within the United States but is designed to be adaptable for other countries. It addresses known gaps in existing medical terminologies and provides instructions for testing and implementing the FHIR API.
