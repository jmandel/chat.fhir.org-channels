The Medication Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) IG aims to improve how healthcare providers interact with REMS programs, which are special safety requirements mandated by the FDA for certain medications with serious risks. The IG promotes a standardized way to exchange REMS information electronically using the FHIR standard, specifically by leveraging CDS Hooks and SMART App Launch. CDS Hooks enable REMS program administrators to send alerts and guidance to providers within their EHR systems, while SMART App Launch allows providers to access interactive applications that streamline REMS tasks like patient enrollment. When a provider encounters a REMS medication in a patient's record, the EHR can communicate with the REMS administrator's system to provide necessary information and guide the provider through the required steps. This approach aims to reduce manual processes, improve communication between healthcare providers and REMS administrators, and ultimately enhance patient safety by ensuring REMS requirements are met efficiently. The current version of the IG focuses on the needs of prescribers and their interactions with REMS administrators, acknowledging the variability of REMS programs and the importance of integrating with existing e-prescribing workflows and EHR systems. It prioritizes flexibility and does not mandate specific workflows or require all REMS steps to be electronic.
