The Health Care Surveys Reporting IG aims to improve the process of gathering data for national health surveys in the United States. It focuses on automating the way information is extracted from EHRs and sent securely to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The IG utilizes the FHIR standard, along with the US Core profiles, which specify how common clinical concepts are represented in FHIR. It also leverages the MedMorph Reference Architecture, a framework for automated reporting. When the NCHS needs data for a specific survey, it defines the requirements and shares them electronically. A Health Data Exchange App then uses these requirements to set up automatic notifications within a healthcare provider's EHR system. When a relevant event happens, like a patient visit being completed, the app retrieves the necessary data from the EHR using standard methods. Finally, the app formats the data into a standardized report and transmits it securely to the NCHS. This approach is intended to simplify data collection for surveys like the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Care Survey, which traditionally relied on manual methods or less detailed claims data. The IG primarily targets hospital and ambulatory care settings and does not cover areas like nursing homes or data quality checks. Its effectiveness depends on the adoption of FHIR and the MedMorph architecture by both EHR vendors and healthcare providers.
