This IG defines a standardized way to create and share research study forms electronically using FHIR. It aims to simplify the process of obtaining approval for multi-site research studies that use a single sIRB. The IG focuses on replacing the inefficient exchange of paper or document-based forms with structured, digital questionnaires that can be easily completed and shared between different institutions. These questionnaires cover common forms like research protocols, informed consent documents, and adverse event reports. The guide also leverages FHIR's ability to pre-fill common information across different forms, reducing the workload for research staff. While the IG does not address integrating data into existing research management systems, it offers a simplified approach for institutions to adopt standardized forms, even with limited technical resources. The guide acknowledges that future versions may expand to include more complex features and integration capabilities as the use of FHIR in research study management matures.
