This IG defines a standard way to exchange a basic set of patient information, known as the International Patient Summary (IPS), between different healthcare systems. The guide aims to improve the sharing of crucial patient data, especially during emergencies or international travel, by creating a consistent and understandable format for electronic health records. It uses Health Level Seven Clinical Document Architecture Release 2 (HL7 CDA R2), a widely accepted standard for health information, to structure the IPS content. The guide specifies how to organize essential patient details, like allergies, medications, and past diagnoses, within the document. It also encourages the use of standard medical terminologies, like Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), to ensure clear communication across different languages and systems. The IPS is intentionally concise, focusing on information needed for unplanned or immediate care, and it is designed to be relevant regardless of the patient's specific medical condition or the healthcare provider's specialty. While it aims to be globally applicable, the guide acknowledges that it may not cover every possible medical scenario or data element. It also emphasizes the importance of documenting the origin of the information and supports the inclusion of translated text for better accessibility.
