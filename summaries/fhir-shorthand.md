This IG introduces FHIR Shorthand (FSH), a new language designed to make it easier to create and manage healthcare data standards using FHIR. Previous methods for developing these standards, such as manually editing FHIR artifacts or using spreadsheets, proved to be complex or prone to errors. FSH offers a simpler, text-based approach that is more user-friendly and scalable. It works by utilizing a compiler called SUSHI, which translates FSH code into standard FHIR artifacts, ensuring compatibility with existing systems. Additionally, a tool called GoFSH can convert existing FHIR artifacts into FSH, making it possible to transition older projects. FSH is specifically designed for creating IGs, which are collections of FHIR artifacts that define data standards for specific healthcare scenarios. Because it is open-source and community-driven, FSH promotes collaboration and aims to increase the accessibility and efficiency of defining and managing healthcare data standards, ultimately contributing to improved data exchange in healthcare.
