**TL;DR:** This guide explains FHIR Shorthand (FSH), a language for creating and sharing healthcare data standards.

The FHIR Shorthand Implementation Guide defines a language called FSH, which is used to build and share standards for exchanging healthcare data. FSH makes it easier to create these standards, called "implementation guides," which ensure healthcare information can be shared accurately and consistently between different computer systems.

FSH helps to simplify the process of creating these implementation guides. It uses a clear and concise syntax that is easier to understand and manage than other methods.  This allows developers to focus on the content of the standards without getting bogged down in technical details. 

FSH also supports collaboration and version control, enabling teams to work together on implementation guides and track changes over time. This ensures that the standards are always up-to-date and accurate. 

By making it easier to develop and share healthcare data standards, FSH plays a crucial role in improving the interoperability of healthcare systems, ultimately leading to better patient care.
