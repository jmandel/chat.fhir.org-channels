**TL;DR:** This guide helps researchers get the health data they need more quickly and easily.

The MedMorph Research Data Exchange Implementation Guide (IG) aims to make it faster and easier to get health data for research. It sets standards for how electronic health records (EHRs) and other health data sources can share information with research organizations. 

This guide focuses on making it easier to add new data partners to research networks. It uses a standardized process to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data, which can currently be a slow and complex process. This standardized approach can save time and money while also improving the quality of the data.

The guide also addresses how to make sure data is shared securely and with the right permissions. It specifies how healthcare organizations can make sure they meet patient privacy rules and get the necessary approvals before sharing data.

It's important to note that this guide does not cover all aspects of research data exchange. It does not address state and local rules about data sharing, how to check the quality of the data, or how researchers can use the data once they have it. 

The goal of this guide is to improve the efficiency of research data exchange, allowing researchers to access the information they need more quickly and easily. This can help speed up research and potentially lead to new discoveries that improve patient care.
