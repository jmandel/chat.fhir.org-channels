**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems find and share information about healthcare providers and services.

The National Directory Implementation Guide helps healthcare providers and organizations share information about their services and how to connect with them electronically. This includes details like locations, contact information, specialties, insurance networks, and whether they are accepting new patients.

The guide defines ways to ensure the information is accurate and up-to-date. It also includes ways to protect sensitive information, making sure only authorized people can access it.

This guide is designed to work with a large national system. However, it can also be used for smaller, local systems. 

The goal of this guide is to make it easier for healthcare providers and organizations to connect and share information, ultimately improving healthcare for everyone.
