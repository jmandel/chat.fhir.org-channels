**TL;DR:** This guide helps improve how cancer pathology reports are shared between labs, hospitals, and cancer registries in the US. It uses a standardized format to make sure the important information from these reports is accurately collected and easily understood by all parties.

The Cancer Pathology Data Sharing Implementation Guide (IG) aims to standardize the way cancer pathology data is collected and shared. It focuses on how pathology reports, which contain crucial information about a patient's diagnosis, are transmitted from labs to cancer registries. This can happen directly or through a hospital's electronic health record system (EHR).

This guide is important because it promotes a structured approach to handling pathology reports. Traditionally, these reports might be shared as non-searchable documents, like PDFs. This can make it difficult to extract specific information or analyze data across many reports. By using a standardized format, this guide ensures that the data in pathology reports is organized in a way that computers can easily understand and process.

The guide relies on a specific format called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), which is becoming a common standard for exchanging healthcare information. It also aligns with existing standards from organizations like the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP).

Currently, this guide works best when labs use specific digital checklists from the CAP. In the future, it may be expanded to handle other types of pathology reports.

The main users of this guide are the people who design and build the computer systems used in labs, hospitals, and cancer registries. However, anyone involved in cancer care, including patients, can benefit from understanding how this guide helps improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer reporting.

In short, this guide represents an important step towards better sharing of cancer pathology data, which can ultimately lead to improved patient care and research.
