## TL;DR: 

This guide helps hospitals and public health agencies share information about resources like beds, ventilators, and COVID-19 tests more easily and automatically.

## Detailed Summary:

The Situational Awareness for Novel Epidemic Response (SANER) Implementation Guide defines a standard way for hospitals to report important information to public health agencies, especially during emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.  This guide focuses on sharing data about the number of available hospital beds, ventilators, and COVID-19 test results. 

The guide uses the FHIR standard (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) to define a common language for exchanging this information. This means that different computer systems in hospitals and public health agencies can share data automatically, without needing manual entry. 

The SANER guide defines different "actors," like hospitals and public health agencies, and the specific actions they can take. For example, a hospital can automatically send a report with its latest bed availability to a public health agency. The guide also allows public health agencies to request specific information from hospitals, like the number of ventilators in use.

This automated data sharing helps public health officials make better decisions during emergencies. They can quickly see which hospitals have available resources and where help is needed most. The guide also helps to improve data quality and reduce errors, since information is shared directly from hospital systems. While the guide initially focuses on COVID-19, it can be used for other public health emergencies as well.
