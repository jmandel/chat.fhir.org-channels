The MedMorph Reference Architecture IG aims to streamline the process of collecting and sharing healthcare data for public health reporting and research. It proposes a standardized, automated approach to reduce manual work for healthcare providers and improve the quality and speed of data transfer. The guide introduces a framework called "MedMorph" that utilizes machine-readable instructions, known as Knowledge Artifacts, to define what data to collect and how to format it. A Health Data Exchange App (HDEA) acts as a background application within a healthcare setting, automatically extracting and submitting data based on these instructions. The framework also incorporates a Trust Service Provider for de-identifying patient data to ensure privacy. By leveraging the FHIR standard, the IG promotes interoperability between different healthcare systems. The MedMorph framework allows public health agencies and research organizations to define their data needs, while healthcare systems can automate the process of fulfilling these requests in a secure and standardized manner. The IG acknowledges that implementing this approach may require a phased rollout and emphasizes the importance of collaboration with other initiatives to ensure harmonization and avoid duplication of efforts.
