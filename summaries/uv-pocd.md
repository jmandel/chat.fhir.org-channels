This IG aims to standardize how medical devices in hospitals and clinics share data with other healthcare systems, such as EHRs and clinical decision support tools. It focuses on providing more detailed information, including device details, calibration, and status, along with patient measurements. The guide leverages FHIR for better data organization and exchange. It structures medical device and measurement data using a model based on the IEEE 11073 standard. This IG also offers ways to map data from older standards to FHIR. Currently, it focuses on professional medical devices in acute care and doesn't cover home-use devices or imaging systems. Waveform data and device alerts are planned for future releases. The goal is to improve the quality, consistency, and accessibility of medical device data for better patient care, research, and analysis.
