**TL;DR:** This guide defines a new standard for Personal Health Records (PHRs) that makes it easier for patients to collect, manage, and share their health information with doctors and others.

The Standard Patient Health Record (SPHR) Implementation Guide helps software developers create PHRs that can easily exchange information with other health systems and apps. This is important because it allows patients to have a complete and up-to-date record of their health information, even if they have received care from multiple providers. 

The guide uses the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, which is a widely used standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. This ensures that PHRs built using this guide can easily share data with hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare organizations that also use FHIR. 

The SPHR standard also addresses the challenge of storing large amounts of health information over a patient's lifetime. It defines a secure file format for PHRs, which can be easily stored and transferred between systems. This means patients can keep their own copy of their health records and share it with anyone they choose.

Finally, the guide includes examples of common patient health journeys, such as a child with leukemia or an adult with diabetes. These examples illustrate how the SPHR standard can be used to capture and organize real-world health information.
