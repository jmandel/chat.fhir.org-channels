This IG focuses on improving how computer systems share information about medicines, making it easier for both patients and healthcare providers to access reliable details about medications. Traditionally, medicine information has been provided in formats like PDF documents, which are difficult to search, not user-friendly, and hard to integrate with digital tools like EHRs. This IG introduces a new approach using the FHIR standard, a modern framework for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It structures medicine information using FHIR resources, ensuring consistency through standardized codes and terms, and offers flexibility for regional variations. Developed through global collaboration, the IG prioritizes interoperability, accessibility for people with disabilities, and defines different types of electronic Product Information (ePI) documents to cater to various needs. While the FHIR-based approach offers significant improvements in making medicine information more accessible and machine-readable, challenges related to global adoption and consistent implementation across different healthcare systems may still need to be addressed.
