**TL;DR:** This guide defines a common standard for sharing information about medicines electronically. 

The Electronic Product Information (ePI) Implementation Guide helps create a common way to share information about medicines between computer systems. This includes information for healthcare providers, information for patients, and the information on the package label. 

Right now, this information is often shared as a PDF, which makes it hard to search and use. This guide recommends using a new technology called HL7 FHIR to share this information. HL7 FHIR makes it easier to search the information and to use it in different ways, like on websites and in mobile apps.

This guide defines a common set of data elements and codes that can be used to describe medicines. It also defines different types of ePI documents, depending on the type of information they contain. For example, a "Type 1" document might only contain the narrative text of the package leaflet, while a "Type 3" document might also contain structured information about the medicine's ingredients and clinical use. 

This guide is meant to be a starting point for developing more specific guides for different regions. For example, the guide could be used to develop separate guides for the USA, the European Union, and Japan. This would ensure that information about medicines can be shared easily between different countries.
