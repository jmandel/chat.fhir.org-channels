**TL;DR:** This guide helps share important patient information between different healthcare systems around the world.

The International Patient Summary (IPS) Implementation Guide defines a standard way to share key patient medical information, especially for unplanned care situations. It ensures that healthcare providers in different countries or regions can understand and use this information, even if they use different electronic health record (EHR) systems.

The guide focuses on creating a concise summary of essential patient data, including allergies, medications, past medical problems, procedures, immunizations, and more. It allows for this information to be coded using standard medical terminologies, making it easier for computers to process and exchange the data. It also supports the inclusion of human-readable text for clarity.

Recognizing the need for information to be understood across language barriers, the guide provides mechanisms for translating medical terms and narratives. This helps ensure that patients traveling abroad can have their medical information readily available and understood by healthcare providers in other countries.

The IPS Implementation Guide is a technical document primarily intended for developers and implementers of EHR systems and other health information technology. However, its ultimate goal is to improve patient safety and care coordination by facilitating the seamless exchange of vital medical information across borders and healthcare systems.
