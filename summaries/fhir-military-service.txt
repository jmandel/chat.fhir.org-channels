**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems share information about a patient's military service history.

The Military Service History and Status Implementation Guide (IG) defines a standard way to record and exchange information about a person's military service using FHIR. It was designed to meet the needs of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but can be adapted for other countries. 

This IG helps healthcare providers understand the health risks associated with military service, including deployments and combat experience. It also allows veterans to easily share their military service information with community healthcare providers, hospitals, and other organizations. 

The IG includes ways to verify if someone is a veteran and to record details about their service, such as their branch, dates of service, deployments, and job roles. This information is important for providing appropriate care to veterans, as their military experiences can have long-term effects on their physical and mental health.
