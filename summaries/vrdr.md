## VRDR Implementation Guide Summary for Non-Experts

**TL;DR:** This guide helps standardize how death records are shared electronically between different health systems. It allows state vital records offices to send death certificate information to the CDC in a consistent way, making it easier to track and analyze death trends across the country.

The Vital Records Death Reporting (VRDR) Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on standardizing the electronic sharing of death record information between state vital records offices and the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).  

This guide addresses the need for a consistent and reliable method of transmitting death records electronically. It leverages the FHIR standard to ensure that different computer systems can understand and process the information. This standardization helps NCHS collect complete and accurate death data, which is essential for tracking public health trends, identifying causes of death, and developing effective health policies.

The IG covers all the essential information found on a death certificate, including:

* **Decedent Demographics:** Information about the deceased person, such as their name, date of birth, address, and marital status.
* **Death Investigation:** Details surrounding the death, such as the date and time of death, location of death, and whether an autopsy was performed.
* **Death Certification:**  Information about the person who certified the death, the manner of death, and the causes of death.
* **Decedent Disposition:** Details about the handling of the deceased person's remains, including the funeral home and method of disposition.
* **Coded Content:** Standardized codes for causes of death, race and ethnicity, and other information, to allow for easier analysis and comparison of data.

The VRDR IG also supports the exchange of coded cause of death information from NCHS back to the states, and the exchange of mortality roster information between states. This comprehensive approach helps ensure that death records are accurately and efficiently shared across the entire U.S. mortality data ecosystem.
