The Vital Records Death Reporting (VRDR) IG aims to improve how death records are shared electronically. It establishes a standard way for different computer systems involved in the death registration process, such as those used by hospitals, funeral homes, and government agencies, to exchange information about deaths. This new standard uses a structured format called FHIR, replacing the older format called Interjurisdictional Exchange (IJE). The guide defines specific templates for different pieces of information found in a death record, like the person's name, date of birth, cause of death, and location of death. It focuses on how states send death records to the National Center for Health Statistics and attempts to ensure that the new format can work with other systems and data flows in the death registration process. The guide also provides instructions on how to convert information from the old format to the new one to help with the transition. This initiative is part of a broader effort to modernize how death records are managed in the United States.
