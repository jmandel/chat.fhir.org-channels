The Adverse Event Research Backport IG aims to standardize the collection and sharing of adverse event information, particularly in clinical trials. Adverse events are negative side effects or health problems occurring during medical treatment or research. Using FHIR, this IG enables different computer systems, like EHRs and patient portals, to easily exchange information about adverse events. Previously, inconsistent data formats required manual entry, leading to potential errors and delays. This IG addresses this by creating a specific format for adverse event data within FHIR, including details like severity, suspected causes (e.g., drug or procedure), likelihood of causality, and mitigating steps. It also considers different research stages, various sources of adverse event information, and regulations from agencies like the FDA. Based on the upcoming FHIR version (R5) but available in the current version (R4), this IG will also support future electronic reporting to the FDA's MedWatch system, which tracks adverse events related to drugs and medical devices.
