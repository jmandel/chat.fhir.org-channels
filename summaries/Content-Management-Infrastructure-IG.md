The Content-Management-Infrastructure IG seeks to address challenges in managing and sharing digital healthcare knowledge, such as clinical guidelines, quality measures, and patient questionnaires. It proposes a standardized approach using FHIR to represent this knowledge consistently. This involves defining profiles for different knowledge types, implementing version control to track changes, and enabling the packaging of related resources for easier sharing. The IG also suggests the use of specialized servers called artifact repositories to store and manage these resources, promoting discoverability and reusability. While the IG aims to improve consistency and interoperability, its reliance on FHIR and the adoption of its principles require careful consideration. Additionally, the decentralized nature of the proposed ecosystem may present challenges in coordinating updates and ensuring widespread adoption. The IG's success depends on its ability to overcome these challenges and foster collaboration among healthcare organizations and technology developers.
