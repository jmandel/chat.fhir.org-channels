The Patient Correction IG defines a standard way for patients to electronically request changes to their medical records using FHIR. This IG aims to replace older methods with a streamlined, digital process. It outlines how patient applications can communicate with provider systems, like EHRs, to send correction requests, updates, and supporting information. The guide also describes how healthcare providers can review these requests and communicate back to patients with resolutions. It uses the FHIR Task resource to track the progress of each request. While the IG focuses on the communication between patients and providers, it doesn't dictate the internal processes healthcare providers use to manage corrections. Currently, patients need to actively check for updates on their requests, but future versions may include automatic notifications. The IG also highlights the importance of secure communication and data privacy, aligning with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.
