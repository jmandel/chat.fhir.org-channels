The NHSN Adverse Drug Event (ADE) FHIR IG aims to create a standardized method for hospitals to electronically report data on patients experiencing low or high blood sugar (hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia) during their hospital stay to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This guide facilitates the electronic exchange of healthcare information by defining how hospitals should structure data about blood sugar levels, medication administration, and relevant patient details (diagnoses, procedures, etc.) using the FHIR standard. The IG focuses specifically on hypo- and hyperglycemia events that occur during inpatient hospital stays and requires reporting data at the individual patient level, including each blood glucose measurement and medication administration, which allows for a detailed analysis of the relationship between medications and blood sugar fluctuations. The guide leverages FHIR Composition resources to package all relevant patient data for each encounter and aligns with existing quality reporting metrics from the National Quality Forum, ensuring the collected data's relevance to national quality improvement efforts. It is designed to enable hospitals to use their EHRs as the primary data source, simplifying the reporting process. The IG intends to improve data comparison across hospitals and identify areas for improvement on a national scale by standardizing data reporting.
