## Vulcan Schedule of Activities Implementation Guide: Summary for Non-Experts

**TL;DR:** This guide helps standardize how clinical trial schedules are represented and shared electronically. It enables systems like electronic health records (EHRs) to understand and manage the activities that need to be done during a clinical trial, such as taking medication, getting lab tests, and completing questionnaires, at the right time.

The Vulcan Schedule of Activities Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on improving the exchange of clinical trial schedule information between different healthcare systems. It specifically addresses how to represent the schedule of activities, a crucial part of a clinical trial protocol that outlines what needs to be done and when, using the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. This allows for better integration of research activities within routine healthcare.

This IG addresses several key needs within the healthcare ecosystem:

* **Standardizing the representation of clinical trial schedules:** The IG provides a common way to describe the different activities in a clinical trial, including when they should happen and any flexibility in timing. This helps ensure that everyone involved in the trial, including researchers, clinicians, and patients, has a clear understanding of the schedule.
* **Enabling electronic systems to manage trial activities:** By using FHIR, the IG enables EHRs and other systems to understand and manage trial activities. This can automate tasks like scheduling appointments, ordering tests, and reminding patients about their medications, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.
* **Supporting different types of trials and research activities:** The IG can be used for various clinical trials, including interventional trials (where a treatment is being tested) and observational trials (where data is collected without intervention). It can also support different types of research activities, such as administering investigational products, collecting data through questionnaires, and managing unscheduled activities.
* **Improving data quality and compliance:** The IG helps ensure that data is collected at the right time and in a consistent way across different sites and systems, improving data quality and compliance with the trial protocol.

The IG leverages FHIR resources like ResearchStudy, PlanDefinition, and ActivityDefinition to represent the different aspects of a clinical trial schedule. It also provides guidance on how to manage specific scenarios, such as visit windows (flexibility in visit timing) and investigational product administration.

While this IG provides a solid foundation for representing and exchanging clinical trial schedules, it acknowledges that there are areas for future development. These include managing unscheduled activities, complex protocols, and non-trial integrations. The IG aims to be a living document that evolves to meet the needs of the research community.

In summary, the Vulcan Schedule of Activities IG aims to improve the efficiency and quality of clinical trials by standardizing the representation and management of trial schedules using FHIR. It helps bridge the gap between clinical research and routine healthcare, enabling better integration and automation of research activities.
