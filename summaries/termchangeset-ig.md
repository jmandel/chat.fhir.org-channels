The TermChangeSet IG defines a standard way to represent and share updates to medical terminologies, such as LOINC and SNOMED CT, which are used to represent medical concepts in a standardized way. These terminologies are constantly being updated with new terms and definitions, and this IG aims to make it easier for healthcare systems to incorporate these changes. It does this by creating a structured format, called a "Terminology Change Set," that packages these updates in a consistent and easily understandable way. This format includes information about the update itself, like the source and date, as well as details about the specific changes being made, such as new terms, updated definitions, or changes to existing terms. The IG also specifies how to track the history of changes, ensuring transparency and traceability. By providing a standardized way to represent and share terminology updates, the IG aims to improve the consistency and accuracy of medical data, ultimately supporting better healthcare.
