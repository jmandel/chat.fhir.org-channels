**TL;DR:** This guide explains how to package updates to medical vocabularies so they can be easily shared and understood by different computer systems. 

The Terminology Change Set Implementation Guide (IG) focuses on standardizing the way changes to medical terminologies are packaged and shared. This makes it easier for healthcare computer systems to stay up-to-date with the latest terms and definitions, ensuring that health information is accurate and consistent. 

This guide explains how to use the FHIR standard to represent changes to existing terminologies like LOINC and SNOMED CT. It defines a way to describe new terms, changes to existing terms, and details like who made the changes and why. This helps ensure that everyone using these terminologies has access to the same information.

The IG does not change the content of any specific medical vocabulary. Instead, it provides a consistent way to package updates to these vocabularies.
