The Da Vinci Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD) IG seeks to improve how healthcare providers determine insurance coverage for their patients. It aims to provide real-time coverage information directly within EHR systems during the treatment decision-making process. Currently, providers often rely on manual and time-consuming methods, such as phone calls or payer websites, to obtain this information. The CRD IG leverages FHIR to facilitate communication between provider EHR systems and payer systems. The provider's EHR sends a request for coverage information, and the payer's system responds with details about covered services, pre-authorization requirements, and necessary documentation, ideally within five seconds. This information is presented to the provider through alerts within the EHR and can be used to update orders automatically. While the CRD IG has the potential to streamline workflows and improve accuracy, challenges remain, including ensuring data accuracy, protecting patient privacy, and achieving widespread adoption among payers and providers. The initiative is still under development and will require ongoing collaboration to meet the needs of all stakeholders.
