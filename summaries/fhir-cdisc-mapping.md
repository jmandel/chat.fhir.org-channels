Okay, I'm ready to create a patient-friendly summary of a FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) when you provide the source files. 

Just paste the relevant text from the IG, and I'll follow your guidelines to generate a clear and concise summary that explains:

* **What the IG does in simple terms (TL;DR)**
* **The specific purpose and scope of the IG**
* **How the IG addresses healthcare needs**
* **Any relevant technical terms, explained in plain language** 

I'll make sure the summary is easy to understand for someone without a technical background, keeps it within 200-400 words, and follows your tone and style guidelines. 

Let me know when you have the IG content ready! I'm here to help.
