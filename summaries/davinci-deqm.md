The DEQM IG aims to improve how healthcare data is shared for assessing and reporting the quality of care. It addresses the challenges of traditional methods by establishing a standardized framework using FHIR. The DEQM IG defines how common healthcare data elements should be structured, enabling consistent understanding across different systems. It outlines scenarios for providers to send patient data to entities like payers and quality organizations or respond to requests for specific data. Additionally, it standardizes how quality measure results are reported, both for individual patients and groups. The DEQM IG also supports identifying and addressing gaps in care by comparing recommended care with actual care provided. While the IG leverages existing standards and promotes efficient data exchange, it does not specify detailed security measures, leaving those to implementers. It also acknowledges that different organizations may use different versions of FHIR and offers guidance for compatibility. By promoting standardized data exchange, the DEQM IG aims to facilitate more accurate, timely, and efficient quality measurement, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare quality.
