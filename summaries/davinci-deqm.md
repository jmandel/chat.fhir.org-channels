**TL;DR:** This guide defines how to use a common language (FHIR) to exchange information needed for quality measurement and reporting.

The Data Exchange for Quality Measures (DEQM) Implementation Guide defines how healthcare providers and payers can share information needed to calculate and report on the quality of healthcare. This guide defines how to represent the information needed to calculate quality measures and how to share that information between healthcare providers and payers. It also defines how to exchange reports that summarize quality measures for individual patients or entire populations.

This guide supports a variety of use cases, including:
- Submitting data to payers about quality measures, such as whether a patient received a medication reconciliation after being discharged from the hospital.
- Requesting data from providers about quality measures, such as whether a patient received a recommended cancer screening.
- Sharing reports with payers about quality measures, such as the percentage of patients who received a flu vaccine.
- Identifying gaps in care, which are instances where patients did not receive recommended care.

This guide is based on the FHIR standard, which is a common language for exchanging healthcare information. By using FHIR, healthcare providers and payers can more easily share information and improve the quality of care.
