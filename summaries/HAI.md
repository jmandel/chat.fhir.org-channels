**TL;DR:** This guide helps computer systems share information about healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The HL7 Implementation Guide for FHIR: Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) Reports specifies how electronic health records and other computer systems can send HAI data to the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This network tracks HAIs to help improve patient safety and prevent infections.

The guide defines how to structure HAI reports using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, a common way to exchange healthcare information electronically. It includes guidelines for reporting different types of HAIs, such as bloodstream infections and surgical site infections, which are infections that happen after surgery.

This guide is important because it enables healthcare providers to easily and accurately report HAIs to the CDC. This information can then be used to track infection rates, identify trends, and develop strategies to prevent future infections. By making it easier to share HAI data, this guide helps to improve patient safety and the quality of healthcare.

The guide focuses on single-person reports, which contain information about infections in individual patients, and population summary reports, which summarize infection data for a group of patients. The guide also includes instructions on how to map the FHIR-based reports to the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) standard, which is another way to exchange healthcare information electronically.

This guide is intended for software developers who want to enable their systems to send HAI data to the NHSN. It assumes developers already know about FHIR and aims to provide the specific details they need to create systems that can share this important information.
