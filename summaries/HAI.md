This IG focuses on standardizing how healthcare facilities send electronic reports about healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) to the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). These reports are essential for tracking and preventing HAIs. The IG uses FHIR to define how this information should be structured, making it easier for computer systems to exchange this data. It leverages FHIR's capabilities for representing structured forms, similar to the paper forms currently used by NHSN. The guide provides templates for different types of HAI reports (like surgical site infections or bloodstream infections) and examples of how completed reports should look. Additionally, it uses standardized codes for data elements like infection types, ensuring consistency across different systems. The IG focuses specifically on the electronic submission of these reports and does not cover other aspects of NHSN participation. It was developed alongside a similar guide using an older standard, ensuring that both approaches are aligned. It also aligns with broader standards for representing patient information in the US. The IG is expected to go through several trial versions before being finalized.
