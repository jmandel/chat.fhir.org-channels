The SMART Health Cards Vaccination IG defines a standardized way to represent vaccination and infectious disease test records in a format suitable for SMART Health Cards. These cards, often accessed through a scannable QR code, enable individuals to easily share their health information with entities requiring verification, such as airlines or event organizers. The IG achieves standardization by creating specific profiles for common health data elements like patient demographics, immunization details, and observation (test) results, ensuring consistency in how this information is recorded and interpreted. To address privacy concerns and the limited storage capacity of QR codes, the IG emphasizes data minimization, offering two profile sets: "Primary" for minimal information and "Fallback" for situations where additional details are necessary. Key aspects of a patient's record, like vaccine types, are coded using standardized terminologies to ensure clarity and interoperability across different systems. The IG prioritizes representing information for easy verification of vaccination or test status, rather than complex clinical evaluations. While initially focused on pandemic-related needs, the IG is designed to be internationally applicable and encourages jurisdictions to develop their own profiles based on this framework, promoting a globally consistent approach to sharing verifiable health information.
