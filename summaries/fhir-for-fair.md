This IG explains how healthcare researchers and data scientists can better organize and share their data using FHIR. The guide addresses challenges with finding and reusing research data by suggesting data be structured with FHIR. It provides instructions on how to map existing data elements to FHIR resources, which are like templates for different types of health information. The guide also recommends creating profiles that specify which FHIR elements are essential for particular research needs and using extensions to add details like licensing or the data's origin. It emphasizes using FHIR's built-in search capabilities to help researchers find relevant data. The guide acknowledges that making research data more accessible and reusable is a continuous process and encourages a step-by-step approach. It also highlights the importance of collaboration within the research community to define relevant details, develop FHIR profiles, and create IGs for specific use cases. The main focus of this guide is on situations where FHIR is used directly to represent data.
