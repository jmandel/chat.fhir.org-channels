This IG provides a standardized method for converting healthcare data from IHE Structured Data Capture (SDC) forms into FHIR. This process facilitates easier sharing and analysis of healthcare information between different computer systems.  Traditionally, IHE SDC forms relied on a format that posed challenges for seamless data exchange. This guide addresses these challenges by outlining how to represent the information captured in SDC forms, such as answers to questions, using FHIR resources. It provides specific instructions for handling various question types, including single-select, multi-select, and text answers. The guide also describes how to package the converted information for efficient transport and interpretation. Furthermore, it emphasizes the use of standard terminologies to ensure that the meaning of the data is consistently understood across different platforms. While primarily focused on representing question-and-answer data, the guide also explores ways to handle more complex data structures in the future. By enabling the conversion of SDC data into FHIR, this guide aims to improve the interoperability of healthcare data and support better healthcare data management and analysis.
