The Bulk Data Access IG defines a standardized method for exchanging large healthcare datasets between computer systems using FHIR. It addresses the limitations of existing approaches, which often involve complex and inefficient custom processes. The IG introduces a specific API operation called "$export" that enables clients, such as EHRs or health information exchanges, to request bulk data exports. The process is asynchronous: a client initiates a request and periodically checks its status until the data is ready for download. The data is then provided as files in a structured format like newline-delimited JSON. The IG emphasizes secure data exchange using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and OAuth 2.0 for authorization, along with robust access controls. It offers flexibility by allowing servers to define their data packaging strategies and provides options for filtering and including related data. While the asynchronous approach is designed to handle large datasets efficiently, the IG also acknowledges potential limitations, such as partial export failures. Servers are encouraged to clearly document their bulk data export capabilities to facilitate client integration.
