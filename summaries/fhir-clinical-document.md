This IG defines a standard way to represent clinical documents, such as discharge summaries and progress notes, using FHIR. It aims to improve how healthcare systems exchange these documents digitally by creating a common, consistent format. Previously, many different methods existed, leading to challenges in sharing information between different EHR systems. This IG establishes a clear approach using a FHIR "bundle," which acts like a container for the document. It includes a "composition" resource that serves as a table of contents and header information, along with the main content of the document, ensuring it can be easily read in a web browser. The guide also provides instructions on converting documents from an older standard called Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) to this new FHIR format. It prioritizes human readability, considers security risks, and defines how to manage document updates and errors. This IG aims to be a foundation for more specific clinical document types in the future and is open to feedback on its design choices. While it focuses on representing header information from CDA in this version, it may expand its scope in future updates.
