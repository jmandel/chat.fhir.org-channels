The Patient Advance Care Information and Directives (FHIR-PACIO-ADI) IG defines a standardized way to create, share, and access digital healthcare directives, commonly known as living wills or advance directives. These directives allow individuals to document their preferences for medical treatment if they become unable to communicate them due to illness or injury. The guide utilizes the FHIR standard to structure this information digitally. This enables healthcare providers to easily access and understand a patient's wishes, regardless of their location or healthcare system. The guide supports various formats for storing advance directives, including scanned documents, pre-existing digital documents, and those created directly within FHIR-compliant systems. It also specifies how to exchange these documents securely between different systems and how to ensure the information accessed is the most up-to-date version. While the guide promotes the use of digital signatures for enhanced security, it's not a mandatory requirement. The guide recognizes the importance of capturing the nuances of individual preferences, therefore emphasizing the inclusion of human-readable text alongside standardized codes. It also offers flexibility by supporting the exchange of both complete directive documents and individual sections, catering to different needs and workflows.
