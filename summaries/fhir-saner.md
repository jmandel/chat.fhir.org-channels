The Situational Awareness for Novel Epidemic Response (SANER) IG is a technical standard designed to improve how healthcare facilities share essential information during public health emergencies. It uses FHIR to define a standardized way for hospitals to automatically report data like available beds, ventilators in use, and patient statistics to public health agencies. This approach aims to replace older, less efficient methods that often relied on manual data entry and lacked the ability to keep up with technology advancements. SANER leverages existing FHIR resources and expands them with specific profiles and terminology to ensure that data is consistently represented and understood across different systems. It supports both automated data extraction from hospital EHRs and flexible reporting options to accommodate various infrastructure setups. By enabling a streamlined and automated flow of information, SANER seeks to provide public health officials with a clear and timely understanding of the situation during emergencies, ultimately supporting better resource allocation and decision-making to protect public health. While SANER prioritizes reporting on bed and ventilator capacity, it acknowledges the need for data security and privacy and recommends appropriate measures to safeguard sensitive information. It also allows for flexibility to accommodate local variations in coding practices and workflows within healthcare facilities.
