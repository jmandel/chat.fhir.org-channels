**TL;DR:** This guide defines ways that computer systems can give doctors advice at specific points in patient care.

The CDS Hooks Library defines industry-standard moments in patient care where a computer system can offer advice to healthcare providers. This advice, known as Clinical Decision Support (CDS), can help doctors make better decisions about treatments, tests, and other aspects of patient care. 

CDS Hooks work by identifying specific actions or events in a patient's medical record, such as when a doctor is about to prescribe a medication or when a patient is being discharged from the hospital. When these events occur, the system can automatically send information about the patient and the situation to a separate CDS service. This service can then analyze the information and provide recommendations back to the doctor.

For example, when a doctor is prescribing a medication, the CDS service might check for potential drug interactions or allergies. When a patient is being discharged, it might suggest follow-up appointments or recommend home health services.

The CDS Hooks Library specifies a number of different "hooks," each corresponding to a different point in the patient care workflow. This standardization helps ensure that CDS services can be easily integrated into different electronic health record systems and other healthcare applications.

By providing timely and relevant advice, CDS Hooks can help improve patient safety, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance the overall quality of care.
