The CDS Hooks Library IG aims to create a standard way for clinical decision support (CDS) tools to work with EHRs. Currently, integrating these tools, which provide advice during healthcare decisions, requires custom programming for each EHR. This IG introduces a standardized approach using "hooks," which are specific points in the clinical workflow where a CDS tool can be activated. For example, a hook could be triggered when a doctor is signing an order or viewing a patient's chart. When a hook is triggered, the EHR sends a request to the CDS tool with relevant patient information using the FHIR standard. The CDS tool then processes the request and provides recommendations or advice back to the EHR, which displays it to the clinician. The IG defines a maturity model for hooks, indicating their level of development and adoption, and allows for different versions of FHIR to be used. It focuses on specific workflow steps where CDS can be most effective and was developed through an open community process. The guide also includes a process for retiring outdated hooks. While CDS Hooks offers a standardized approach to improve interoperability between CDS tools and EHRs, its widespread adoption and ultimate impact on healthcare decisions depend on implementation by EHR vendors and CDS developers.
