**TL;DR:** This guide defines standards for sharing verifiable health information, like vaccination records, in a secure digital format using QR codes and links.

The SMART Health Cards and Links Implementation Guide defines how to represent and share verifiable health information using the FHIR standard. It enables patients to receive digital copies of their clinical information, such as vaccination records or test results, and share it with others securely.

This guide addresses the need for a reliable and tamper-proof way to share health information digitally. It uses QR codes and links that can be easily scanned or shared electronically, eliminating the need for paper records that can be easily lost or damaged. The information in these digital records is signed by the issuer, such as a healthcare provider or lab, ensuring its authenticity.

The guide outlines two main approaches: SMART Health Cards and SMART Health Links. Health Cards are designed to hold smaller amounts of information, like a vaccination record, that can be easily shared via a QR code. Health Links, on the other hand, can store larger amounts of data and offer more flexible sharing options, including the ability to share information that updates over time, like a patient's most recent lab results. 

Both Health Cards and Links prioritize patient privacy. They allow patients to choose exactly what information they share and with whom, ensuring they maintain control over their health data.
