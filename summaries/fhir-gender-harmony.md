**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems better understand and exchange information about sex and gender.

The HL7 Cross Paradigm Implementation Guide: Gender Harmony - Sex and Gender Representation, Edition 1 clarifies how to represent and share information about a person's sex and gender in a consistent way across different healthcare systems. It aims to improve patient care and safety by ensuring accurate and respectful handling of this sensitive data.

The guide recognizes that the terms "sex" and "gender" are distinct and have different implications for clinical care. It provides specific guidelines for capturing and exchanging data elements like:

* **Gender Identity:** How a person identifies themselves (e.g., male, female, non-binary).
* **Sex Parameter for Clinical Use:** A categorization of sex based on a patient's anatomy or physiology that is relevant in specific clinical situations, such as ordering tests or interpreting results.
* **Recorded Sex or Gender:** Information about sex or gender from official documents (e.g., birth certificate, driver's license).
* **Name to Use:** The name a person prefers to be called.
* **Pronouns:** The pronouns a person uses (e.g., he/him, she/her, they/them).

The guide offers detailed instructions for exchanging this information using different healthcare data standards, including FHIR, HL7 Version 2, and CDA. It provides examples and use cases to illustrate how these standards can be used to capture and share sex and gender information in a way that is clear, consistent, and respectful of patients. 

By adopting the recommendations in this guide, healthcare systems can improve the quality and accuracy of sex and gender data, leading to better patient care and a reduction in health disparities for transgender, intersex, and gender-diverse individuals.
