The HL7 Cross Paradigm IG: Gender Harmony - Sex and Gender Representation aims to enhance how EHRs store and exchange information about a person's sex and gender. Recognizing that sex (biological traits) and gender (identity) are distinct concepts, the guide promotes a more comprehensive approach than the traditional binary model. It provides instructions for healthcare systems to record a patient's gender identity, sex for clinical use (biological information relevant to medical decisions), recorded sex or gender from legal documents, preferred name, and pronouns. This is achieved by using standardized terminology and extensions within existing health information standards like FHIR, HL7 Version 2, and Clinical Document Architecture (CDA). The guide acknowledges that current systems often conflate sex and gender, leading to limitations in data accuracy and inclusivity. By implementing the recommendations, healthcare providers can capture a broader range of sex and gender information, potentially fostering more respectful and appropriate care for transgender, gender-diverse, and intersex individuals. The guide also addresses the sensitive nature of this information, emphasizing the importance of privacy and security. While it offers minimum value sets for concepts like gender identity and pronouns, it recognizes that these might need adjustments based on local cultural contexts. The guide aims to improve data quality and support more inclusive healthcare practices, but its actual impact on individual patient care or health outcomes is not explicitly defined.
