**TL;DR:** This guide defines standard templates for creating and sharing clinical notes, like those from doctor's visits, in a way computers can easily understand.

The Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) Implementation Guide defines a set of templates for structuring information within clinical notes, ensuring that they can be easily shared and understood by different computer systems. These templates cover various types of clinical notes, such as those documenting consultations, hospital stays, procedures, and ongoing care plans.

The guide addresses the need for consistent and standardized ways to represent patient information, diagnoses, treatments, allergies, medications, and other essential clinical data. By adhering to these templates, healthcare providers and systems can exchange patient information seamlessly, improving care coordination and patient safety.

The guide also provides detailed guidance on how to handle missing or unknown information, ensuring that data is accurately represented even when complete information is unavailable. It also addresses how to link information within a document and to external sources, enabling a more complete picture of a patient's health history.

C-CDA, based on the HL7 CDA standard, relies on XML for data representation. This guide, while using FHIR StructureDefinition for defining the templates, does not rely on FHIR resources or data types. It aims to improve interoperability in the US healthcare system by providing a common language for sharing clinical notes, ultimately benefiting both patients and providers.
