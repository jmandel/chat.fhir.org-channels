The FHIR Registry Protocols IG aims to streamline the process of submitting data to clinical registries, which are systems that collect and analyze healthcare information for research and quality improvement. The IG addresses challenges associated with inconsistent data formats and manual processes by leveraging FHIR. It allows registries to clearly define their data requirements using standardized formats and specify where this data can be found within various healthcare systems, such as EHRs or older message formats. Healthcare providers can then use this information to automatically extract the necessary data and submit it to the registry in a standardized FHIR format. The IG supports various data sources and submission methods, emphasizing automation and security. Its success relies on the adoption of FHIR and the willingness of both registries and healthcare providers to implement its recommendations, ultimately contributing to more efficient and accurate data sharing in healthcare.
