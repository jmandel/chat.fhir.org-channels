The FHIR-us-pq-cmc IG aims to improve how pharmaceutical companies share drug information with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Currently, drug companies submit complex documents that are difficult for computers to analyze. This IG introduces a new approach using FHIR. It defines how to structure information about drug ingredients, manufacturing processes, and quality controls, making it easier for the FDA to review. The guide focuses on submissions related to solid oral medications like tablets and capsules, with plans to expand to other drug types in the future. It aligns with the latest electronic submission standards and offers tools to create human-readable summaries from the structured data. This phased approach to standardizing drug information is expected to streamline the FDA's review process, although the full impact will depend on broader adoption and further development of the guide.
