The Vulcan Real World Data IG aims to simplify the use of EHR data in medical research. It establishes a standardized method for representing and sharing this data using FHIR, enabling researchers to efficiently identify patient groups that meet specific study criteria and retrieve their relevant health information in a consistent format. Researchers can define criteria such as age, diagnosis, or medication to find suitable patients and then access detailed health data for those individuals, including demographics, diagnoses, medications, procedures, and lab results. This IG focuses on using data from EHRs for retrospective studies and builds upon existing efforts like the International Patient Access project. It acknowledges regional variations in data requirements and addresses the challenge of handling missing data. While the current version concentrates on EHRs, future iterations may incorporate other data sources like patient registries and insurance systems. By promoting data standardization, the IG seeks to enhance the efficiency and reliability of medical research.
