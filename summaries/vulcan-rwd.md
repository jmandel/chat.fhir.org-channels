## Real World Data Implementation Guide: A Summary for Patients and Non-Experts

**TL;DR:** This guide helps researchers access and use real-world patient data from electronic health records (EHRs) in a standardized way. This data can be used to study the effectiveness of different treatments and learn more about diseases.

The Real World Data Implementation Guide (IG) aims to improve how researchers use patient data from EHRs for research purposes. It focuses on standardizing how this information is organized and accessed, ensuring that researchers can easily find and understand the data they need. 

This guide addresses several key needs in the healthcare ecosystem:

* **Finding the right patients for research studies:** The IG helps researchers identify groups of patients who meet specific criteria for their studies. For example, researchers studying a new diabetes treatment can easily find patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
* **Accessing complete patient information:** The IG outlines the essential information about a patient's health that should be accessible to researchers. This includes demographics, diagnoses, medications, lab results, procedures, and hospital visits. 
* **Ensuring data quality and consistency:** By standardizing the way data is organized and shared, the IG helps ensure that researchers are working with high-quality, reliable information.

The IG achieves these goals by defining specific data elements that should be collected and shared, as well as by providing guidelines for how to search for and retrieve this data from EHR systems. It also addresses how to handle missing data, ensuring that researchers can understand the limitations of the available information. 

This guide is based on the International Patient Access (IPA) standard, which provides a foundation for accessing patient information in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. It is designed to be used in conjunction with regional standards like US Core, ensuring compatibility with different healthcare systems worldwide.
