The "SDOHCC: Social Determinants of Health Clinical Care" IG aims to improve how healthcare and social service organizations share information about social factors that affect people's health, such as housing, food access, and transportation. It does this by creating a standard way to electronically exchange this information using FHIR. The guide defines specific data formats, uses standardized terminology from the Value Set Authority Center, and outlines processes for sharing information between healthcare providers, patients, and community organizations. It also addresses how to incorporate data from assessment tools into EHRs. This IG focuses on the US healthcare system and emphasizes the importance of patient privacy and consent, aligning with regulations like HIPAA. It also recognizes the need to collaborate with other data exchange guides to ensure broader compatibility. Because the language used to describe social determinants of health is still evolving, the guide will be updated regularly to reflect the latest terminology. By creating a consistent way to exchange this important information, the guide aims to support a more integrated approach to healthcare that considers the full range of factors affecting a person's well-being.
