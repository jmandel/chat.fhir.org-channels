**TL;DR:** This guide helps healthcare systems share information about social factors that can impact a person’s health.

The SDOH Clinical Care Implementation Guide (IG) defines how healthcare providers and other systems can exchange information about social determinants of health (SDOH). SDOH are things like access to food, housing, transportation, and healthcare that can affect a person’s well-being.

This guide helps healthcare providers share information about a patient’s social risks and needs. For example, a doctor could use this guide to electronically refer a patient to a food bank or housing assistance program. The guide also helps providers track the patient’s progress toward their goals, such as finding stable housing or getting access to healthy food.

The guide uses a standard language called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). FHIR makes it easier for different computer systems to talk to each other. This means that a doctor’s electronic health record (EHR) system can share information with a food bank’s system, even if they are made by different companies.

The SDOH Clinical Care IG is important because it helps healthcare providers and social service organizations work together to address the social factors that can affect a person’s health. This can lead to better health outcomes for patients and communities.
