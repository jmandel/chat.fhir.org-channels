This IG defines a standard way for Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS), which track the location of items or people using tags, to share information with other healthcare systems like EHRs. It aims to improve communication between these systems by using FHIR. The guide specifies how systems can request location updates for specific tags, stop receiving those updates, and how the location updates themselves will be structured. Essentially, it acts as a blueprint for how RTLS and other systems can talk to each other about location data. This approach focuses on ensuring that different systems understand the information being exchanged, regardless of the specific RTLS technology being used. The guide does not specify how an RTLS determines a tag's location, leaving that aspect to the individual system. It also allows flexibility in defining what triggers a location update, recognizing that different RTLS implementations may have different criteria for sending updates. By standardizing the communication process, the guide aims to facilitate seamless integration of RTLS data into various healthcare applications.
