The CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) is modernizing how healthcare facilities submit data electronically.  A new IG establishes a standardized method for sharing this data using FHIR.  This guide promotes easier reporting for facilities and streamlines data collection and analysis for the CDC.  It leverages existing health data standards and outlines a framework for reporting using digital quality measures (dQMs) that can be updated without requiring extensive revisions to the guide itself.  The framework focuses on using data that aligns with the US Core standard, a widely recognized set of health data guidelines.  This initiative is part of the CDC's broader data modernization efforts and involves collaboration with other government agencies.  The guide ensures data reported to NHSN remains protected under existing laws and adheres to established privacy and security standards.  It's important to note that this guide provides a general framework, and specific instructions for reporting individual NHSN measures will be provided in a separate document.
