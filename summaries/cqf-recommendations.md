This IG aims to improve healthcare by enabling computers to understand and use clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), which are recommendations for treating specific health conditions. Currently, these guidelines are often written in plain language, making it difficult for EHRs and other computer systems to utilize them effectively. This IG addresses this challenge by introducing a standardized way to represent CPGs using the FHIR standard. This involves creating structured templates for different parts of a CPG, like recommendations and patient characteristics, and using a common language for clinical concepts to ensure everyone understands them the same way. It also involves representing the decision-making logic of guidelines in a computer-readable format called Clinical Quality Language (CQL). By packaging these components together, the IG facilitates the sharing and implementation of CPGs across different healthcare systems, potentially leading to more consistent and efficient care. However, successful implementation depends on factors like the technical capabilities of healthcare systems and the involvement of various stakeholders, including guideline developers and healthcare providers, in the process. The IG acknowledges that different organizations may have varying levels of readiness for adopting these new approaches and aims to support a range of implementation complexities.
