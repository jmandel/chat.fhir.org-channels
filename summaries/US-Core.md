US Core is a standard designed to improve how EHRs and other health IT systems in the United States share patient information. It provides a common set of rules and guidelines, making it easier for different systems to exchange data securely and effectively.

US Core helps ensure that essential patient information, such as demographics, allergies, medications, lab results, and clinical notes, can be accessed and understood by authorized systems. This enables better care coordination, more informed decision-making by healthcare providers, and improved patient care.

The standard is updated regularly to include new types of health information and to keep pace with evolving technologies and standards. It also aligns with federal regulations, such as the USCDI, which mandates specific data elements for nationwide health information exchange.

Patients benefit from US Core by having more control over their health information. It enables them to share their data with authorized apps and providers easily and securely, promoting patient engagement and informed healthcare decisions. Healthcare providers benefit from a more complete picture of their patients' health, leading to better care coordination and treatment plans.
