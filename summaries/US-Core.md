The US Core IG is a set of rules and guidelines designed to improve how electronic health information is shared in the United States. It builds upon FHIR to define a common set of requirements for exchanging information like patient demographics, allergies, medications, lab results, and clinical notes. By establishing this common foundation, the US Core IG aims to make it easier for different health IT systems to communicate with each other, allowing for seamless and secure data exchange. It addresses limitations of previous approaches by providing more comprehensive data profiles, clear guidelines for handling missing information, and standardized ways to access specific types of data like medications and clinical notes. The guide also considers important factors like patient privacy and aligns with national regulations and standards for health information exchange. It is regularly updated to adapt to evolving requirements and feedback from the healthcare community, ensuring it remains relevant and supports the ongoing effort to improve interoperability in the US healthcare system.
