The HAI-LTCF IG aims to simplify how long-term care facilities (LTCFs) send reports about healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Currently, many facilities rely on paper forms or manual data entry on a website, which can be slow and error-prone. This IG introduces a standardized electronic format using FHIR. It defines digital versions of existing CDC forms, specifically for reporting on infections caused by certain resistant organisms. LTCF software systems can use these digital forms to collect the necessary information and automatically generate reports in a format the CDC can easily process. This initial version of the guide focuses on monthly summaries and individual case reports for specific types of infections. It's designed to be user-friendly by mirroring existing paper forms and builds upon established data standards to ensure consistency. It's important to note that this guide is being developed alongside a similar one using a different standard, and both aim to align with the CDC's reporting requirements, which remain the definitive source.
