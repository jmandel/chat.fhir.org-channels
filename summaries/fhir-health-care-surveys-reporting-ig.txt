**TL;DR:** This guide helps automate the way healthcare providers send data to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) for important health surveys.

The Health Care Surveys Content Implementation Guide (IG) defines how electronic health records (EHRs) and other systems can send data needed for the National Hospital Care Survey (NHCS) and the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). These surveys help researchers understand healthcare trends and improve the quality of care.

This guide addresses the need to make it easier and faster for healthcare providers to send data to NCHS. Instead of manual processes, this guide uses a standardized approach that relies on a technology called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). This allows health systems to automatically send data when certain events happen, like when a patient is discharged from the hospital or finishes a visit with their doctor.

The guide covers what data is needed for the surveys, how it should be organized, and how it should be sent securely. It also explains the roles of different systems involved, including the EHR, a special app called the Health Data Exchange App (HDEA), and the NCHS Data Store where the information is stored.

This automated approach reduces the burden on healthcare providers, saving them time and effort. It also helps improve the quality and timeliness of the data sent to NCHS, allowing researchers to get a more accurate picture of healthcare in the United States.

While the guide focuses on specific surveys, it could also be used for other types of data reporting in the future. It does not cover things like how healthcare providers get permission from patients to share their data or how the quality of the data is checked.

The guide uses technical terms like "FHIR profiles" and "Knowledge Artifacts," but it explains these terms clearly so that non-experts can understand them. It is designed to be a helpful resource for anyone who wants to learn more about how this new approach to health data reporting works.
